 Deploying a .NET Core app on Windows Server
 
1. Assign a DNS name to the VM
2. Add a rule for port 8172 to the NSG
3. Add the role of the management service on the VM
4. Check the configuration of the Management service in IIS
5. Install the .net hosting bundle. This allows .net applications to be hosted on IIS
6. Install web deploy v3.6 tool


1. Go to VM overview -> DNS Name -> Click Not configured link -> enter name -> save

2. Add inbound rule for Allow for the port 8172, service -Custom and save this 

3. Server roles -> Web server (IIS) -> Management Tools -> Management services -> Add feature -> install

4. Go to Application in IIS -> Click on the application -> Management services -> Click Enable remote connections (notice this has port number 8172 enabled, that is the reason why we created inbound rule for that port. ) -> Apply 

5.Local server -> IE Enhanced security configuration -> Off for sometime ->  Download .net version you want to serve your application
We only need hosting bundle

6. Download web deploy tool


From your visual studio you can publish your web project. If you want to add your account then Tools -> Options -> Azure Service Authentication -> Choose an account for publish 

We need to login to azure credentials, choose our target VM, subscribtion, Resource group etc and publish. This will create a publish profile 


Instead of creating inbound rule for HTTP port 80 after creating the VM, we can also allow inbound port while creating the VM


Deploying .net app on the Linux VM

We need putty application to connect with Linux VM

1. Host name - Public IP address -> Open -> Yes

Give credentials

2. To publish into Linux -> Create new publish profile -> Folder (local folder or file share - it will create publish version of the project in bin\release\net6.0\publish) -> Publish

3. We need to copy all artifacts from local to linux server using winSCP

4. Host name , Uname and password -> WinSCP connected to the Linux
Left hand side is your local machine, and right hand side is the linux server -> drag and drop folder to Linux after copy is complete go to the terminal type pwd (present working directory) -> ls (list)


5. We need to install .net runtime on ubuntu also, for that we can see the instruction from Microsoft 

Before install .NET, we need to add microsoft package signing key to your list of trusted keys and add the package repository then we can install SDK

dotnet webapp.dll -> 

Duplicate the session and run "curl http://localhost:5000 we will get the response
