 Deploying a .NET Core app on Windows Server
 
1. Assign a DNS name to the VM
2. Add a rule for port 8172 to the NSG
3. Add the role of the management service on the VM
4. Check the configuration of the Management service in IIS
5. Install the .net hosting bundle. This allows .net applications to be hosted on IIS
6. Install web deploy v3.6 tool


1. Go to VM overview -> DNS Name -> Click Not configured link -> enter name -> save

2. Add inbound rule for Allow for the port 8172, service -Custom and save this 

3. Server roles -> Web server (IIS) -> Management Tools -> Management services -> Add feature -> install

4. Go to Application in IIS -> Click on the application -> Management services -> Click Enable remote connections (notice this has port number 8172 enabled, that is the reason why we created inbound rule for that port. ) -> Apply 

5.Local server -> IE Enhanced security configuration -> Off for sometime ->  Download .net version you want to serve your application
We only need hosting bundle

6. Download web deploy tool


From your visual studio you can publish your web project. If you want to add your account then Tools -> Options -> Azure Service Authentication -> Choose an account for publish 

We need to login to azure credentials, choose our target VM, subscribtion, Resource group etc and publish. This will create a publish profile 


Instead of creating inbound rule for HTTP port 80 after creating the VM, we can also allow inbound port while creating the VM


Deploying .net app on the Linux VM

We need putty application to connect with Linux VM

1. Host name - Public IP address -> Open -> Yes

Give credentials

2. To publish into Linux -> Create new publish profile -> Folder (local folder or file share - it will create publish version of the project in bin\release\net6.0\publish) -> Publish

3. We need to copy all artifacts from local to linux server using winSCP

4. Host name , Uname and password -> WinSCP connected to the Linux
Left hand side is your local machine, and right hand side is the linux server -> drag and drop folder to Linux after copy is complete go to the terminal type pwd (present working directory) -> ls (list)


5. We need to install .net runtime on ubuntu also, for that we can see the instruction from Microsoft 

Before install .NET, we need to add microsoft package signing key to your list of trusted keys and add the package repository then we can install SDK

dotnet webapp.dll -> 

Duplicate the session and run "curl http://localhost:5000 we will get the response 
	 



nginx is the webserver for Linux, to install it in linux

sudo get-apt install nginx

to do any configuration changes into linux server nginx we need to stop the server using the command sudo service nginx stop
 

We are inside the Home folder by default click one level up -> etc -> nginx -> sites-available-> default, right click and see the permission for this file, it is 644 we can change its permission to 777 and edit it 

command to change permission is sudo chmod 777 default 

Replace the location configuration to the below

location / {
proxy_pass Http://localhost:5000;
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection Keep-alive;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

}

now start the service again 

sudo service nginx start -> now click on the public IP address then instead of nginx page our web application page will be displaying 


Click on Publish -> Select Azure -> Select Resource group and app service from visual studio


Azure SQL database

When we use VM and install SQL server then you need to configure the server, configure for high availability and configure backups etc. 

But if you choose Azure SQL database then the above mentioned points are taken care by azure itself. 


When we create Azure SQL we will create two resources one is SQL server and one database. 

We can configure which authentication we want and then we can choose network connectivity

  * No Access
  * Public endpoint
  * Private endpoint 

Fireware rules 

Allow Azure services and resources to access this server to yes 

Add current client IP to connect with the database



Publishing from Github
====================

Deployment -> Deployment Settings -> Continous deployment -> Enable 

Github actions -> we can configure when creating app service 

Another way Git -> Git repository->  Create and push -> this will create repository in local and then push those changes to git

Deployment center -> Settings -> Source -> Github -> Repository , Branch, RunTime save 

Go to logs ->  you can see log of deployment . 

If you change and Git changes -> comments and commit then push push. If you go to the github then changes will be reflected. Go to webapp and see the logs
it will show changes in progress or completed. another log we can find. If we invoke the url new content can be seen.


Using the Azure Web app connection string 

We can create connecting string under 

Configuration -> App settings -> Connecting string ->  Value (connecting string ) , Type SQLAzure, Name (connection string name) 


in service class we need Iconfiguration interface to invoke this connection string 

private readonly Iconfiguartion _configuration; 

public ProductService(Iconfiguartion _iConfiguartion  )
{
_configuration = _iconfiguration ; 
}


to get the connection string we need

_configuration.getConnectionString("ConnectionString")




Azure app service logging 

1. Application logging (app code generated error )
2. Web server logging (Raw HTTP request date)
3. Detailed error message (Copies of .htm error pages)
4. Deployment logging 



App service -> app service log -> Application logging (filesystem)
Level 

If you dont want to use existing file system you can keep you logs in seperate storage account. 


app service -> Log stream -> where you can see live loggin
