 Deploying a .NET Core app on Windows Server
 
1. Assign a DNS name to the VM
2. Add a rule for port 8172 to the NSG
3. Add the role of the management service on the VM
4. Check the configuration of the Management service in IIS
5. Install the .net hosting bundle. This allows .net applications to be hosted on IIS
6. Install web deploy v3.6 tool


1. Go to VM overview -> DNS Name -> Click Not configured link -> enter name -> save

2. Add inbound rule for Allow for the port 8172, service -Custom and save this 

3. Server roles -> Web server (IIS) -> Management Tools -> Management services -> Add feature -> install

4. Go to Application in IIS -> Click on the application -> Management services -> Click Enable remote connections (notice this has port number 8172 enabled, that is the reason why we created inbound rule for that port. ) -> Apply 

5.Local server -> IE Enhanced security configuration -> Off for sometime ->  Download .net version you want to serve your application
We only need hosting bundle

6. Download web deploy tool


From your visual studio you can publish your web project. If you want to add your account then Tools -> Options -> Azure Service Authentication -> Choose an account for publish 

We need to login to azure credentials, choose our target VM, subscribtion, Resource group etc and publish. This will create a publish profile 


Instead of creating inbound rule for HTTP port 80 after creating the VM, we can also allow inbound port while creating the VM


Deploying .net app on the Linux VM

We need putty application to connect with Linux VM

1. Host name - Public IP address -> Open -> Yes

Give credentials

2. To publish into Linux -> Create new publish profile -> Folder (local folder or file share - it will create publish version of the project in bin\release\net6.0\publish) -> Publish

3. We need to copy all artifacts from local to linux server using winSCP

4. Host name , Uname and password -> WinSCP connected to the Linux
Left hand side is your local machine, and right hand side is the linux server -> drag and drop folder to Linux after copy is complete go to the terminal type pwd (present working directory) -> ls (list)


5. We need to install .net runtime on ubuntu also, for that we can see the instruction from Microsoft 

Before install .NET, we need to add microsoft package signing key to your list of trusted keys and add the package repository then we can install SDK

dotnet webapp.dll -> 

Duplicate the session and run "curl http://localhost:5000 we will get the response 
	 



nginx is the webserver for Linux, to install it in linux

sudo get-apt install nginx

to do any configuration changes into linux server nginx we need to stop the server using the command sudo service nginx stop
 

We are inside the Home folder by default click one level up -> etc -> nginx -> sites-available-> default, right click and see the permission for this file, it is 644 we can change its permission to 777 and edit it 

command to change permission is sudo chmod 777 default 

Replace the location configuration to the below

location / {
proxy_pass Http://localhost:5000;
proxy_http_version 1.1;
proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
proxy_set_header Connection Keep-alive;
proxy_set_header Host $host;
proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;

}

now start the service again 

sudo service nginx start -> now click on the public IP address then instead of nginx page our web application page will be displaying 


Click on Publish -> Select Azure -> Select Resource group and app service from visual studio


Azure SQL database

When we use VM and install SQL server then you need to configure the server, configure for high availability and configure backups etc. 

But if you choose Azure SQL database then the above mentioned points are taken care by azure itself. 


When we create Azure SQL we will create two resources one is SQL server and one database. 

We can configure which authentication we want and then we can choose network connectivity

  * No Access
  * Public endpoint
  * Private endpoint 

Fireware rules 

Allow Azure services and resources to access this server to yes 

Add current client IP to connect with the database



Publishing from Github
====================

Deployment -> Deployment Settings -> Continous deployment -> Enable 

Github actions -> we can configure when creating app service 

Another way Git -> Git repository->  Create and push -> this will create repository in local and then push those changes to git

Deployment center -> Settings -> Source -> Github -> Repository , Branch, RunTime save 

Go to logs ->  you can see log of deployment . 

If you change and Git changes -> comments and commit then push push. If you go to the github then changes will be reflected. Go to webapp and see the logs
it will show changes in progress or completed. another log we can find. If we invoke the url new content can be seen.


Using the Azure Web app connection string 

We can create connecting string under 

Configuration -> App settings -> Connecting string ->  Value (connecting string ) , Type SQLAzure, Name (connection string name) 


in service class we need Iconfiguration interface to invoke this connection string 

private readonly Iconfiguartion _configuration; 

public ProductService(Iconfiguartion _iConfiguartion  )
{
_configuration = _iconfiguration ; 
}


to get the connection string we need

_configuration.getConnectionString("ConnectionString")




Azure app service logging 

1. Application logging (app code generated error )
2. Web server logging (Raw HTTP request date)
3. Detailed error message (Copies of .htm error pages)
4. Deployment logging 



App service -> app service log -> Application logging (filesystem)
Level 

If you dont want to use existing file system you can keep you logs in seperate storage account. 


app service -> Log stream -> where you can see live loggin 


Azure Web Apps Autoscaling 

Auto scaling features ensures that our web app serves better when there is a change in demand. If the demand is high then it automatically add more VMs and the other way around. 
This autoscaling is manual process and if you need automatic process then you need to go for standard pricing plan. Notice there is no automatic autoscaling in basic and free tiers. We are doing autoscaling on pricing plan not on the app service. Because all app services are priced based on this service plan only. 

Scale up -> change pricing plan
Scale out -> auto scaling rule. 


We can add our custom rule, If my app service's hosting machine

 CPU percentage is above 70%
 for the continous 10 mins
 add another instances
 Maximum you can add 3 instances
 after adding instances wait for 5(cool down time) mins to allow the changes to take effect. 

This is sample rule, you can also configure scale in rule to reduce the instances as well. 

If you see the service plan you can see S1:3. Means now your app service plan is running 3 machines . 

Go to Run history -> Resource instance count will show number of machine instances running 

Operation name -> autoscaling done log will be there 


Azure Web apps -> Custom domains

We need to get custom domains from 3rd party vendors like goDaddy. 

Go to custom domains in the app service -> Add Custom domain -> enter domain and click validate. 

Now Azure will give two types of record "A" and "TXT" records, you need to copy the value from Azure to your 3rd party vendor. This will ensure you own that domain. 

After update this, wait for 10 mins to take changes effect. then again go to azure and add custom domain and validate. Now azure should show validated custom domain, and then add custom domain. Now if you give your custom domain then your web app should be shown. 

Still we need to add SSL certificates to this custom domain otherwise connection is not secure error will be shown in the browser. 


To do this Go to App service -> TLS/SSL settings -> Private key certificates (.pfx) (usually we need to buy certificate, but we are going to use a certificate provided by azure now) 	

Add custom domain name and certificate friendly name. You cannot download this certificate as this is managed by app service. 

Now go back to custom domain -> Add binding ->  Choose private certificate thumbprint -> TLS/SSL Type SNI SSL -> add binding 



Deployment slots

Deployment slots are available in Standard and premium app service plan 

With Deployment slots you have ability to validate application changes in the staging deployment slot and you can swap the staging slot with the production slot. 

This helps eliminate the downtime for your application during deployment 

you can easily swap deployment slots in case of issues. 


Deployment slots will have unique URLs just like differents webapps


Add Deployment slot, then we have option to configure how much traffic to go to another deployment slot. While publishing, we need to select app service and expand deployment slot and select particular deployment slot and then publish 

We have swap option to use which deployment slot. 


When we swap environment we need to wait for warm up time to take effect the swap. We can improve this warmup time by setting up custom warm up 


Deployment slots with Databases

While creating app config click on "Deployment slot setting" checkbox while create app configuration . If we do that then while doing a deployment slot, this will not be copied to new deployment slot. 


Azure App configuration

We have seen that we have configured connection string in web application (configuration section ) itself. But we may have multiple configuration that can be saved in centralized place called App Configuration


Create New resource -> App configuration ->  After resource created -> Configuration explorer -> Create -> key-value ->  give connecting string key value pair and save


To use this we need to install AzureAppConfig nuget package in our project 

App configuration -> Access Keys -> we can take primary key or secondary key. 

var constr='primary key copied from azure app config'

builder.Host.COnfigureAppCOnfiguration(builder => {
builder.AddAzureAppConfigration(constr);
})



Feature flag 

This allows us to toggle on and off based on the need. 

App COnfiguration -> Feature manager -> Add -> name -> Apply 

Install Microsoft.FeatureManagement nuget package.

on builder services in program.cs 
builder.Services.AddFeatureManagement();

builder.Host.COnfigureAppCOnfiguration(options => {
options.connect(constr).UseFeatureFlags();
})


in service 

private readonly IFeatureManager _featureManger



Section 4

Azure Function is serverless , we need to associate Storage account to work with Azure Functions

We can choose Plan type as 
	* Consumption based (serverless)
	* App service plan 
	* Functions Premium 


Create a function 

Development envioronment - Develop in portal
Select a template -  HTTP trigger
Template Detail - Give name for function 

Code + Test -> some template will be already written 
public async Task<bool> IsBeta()
{
return await _featureManager.IsEnabledAsync("beta");
}


We can use this featureflag to control controllers or actions like below

using Microsoft.FeatureManagement;

[FeatureGate(MyFeatureFlags.FeatureA)]
public IActionResult Index()
{
}

If we create azure function from visual studio and publish to azure then we cannot edit code from azure. we can only edit function.json file. 

Same as Webapps, we can also add connection string in function app. Go to FunctionApp -> Configuration -> Connection String -> 


Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SQLAZURECONNSTR_SQLConnectionstring") , SQLAZURECONNSTR is mandatory to include before your connectionstring 



Section 5 

Sudo docker images - will give list of docker available on our linux machine

sudo docker run --name appngnix -p 80:80  -d nginx



(first 80 is the port for the container, container will listen to port 80 and that port is alinged with the Virual machine's port 80)  


sudo docker ps - this will give running dockers 

What is docker file -> docker file will have information for the docker runtime on how to build an image. 

Here we will create publish version of sqlapp application and copy to home/linuxuser via the winscp tool. 


SAMPLE DOCKER FILE 

FROM  mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY..
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet","applicationname.dll"]



to build docker use below command 

sudo docker build -t sqlapp . (docker file should be in your current working directory)

to stop and container

sudo dockefr stop 9ec (this can be full id of the container or first 3 characters)


to remove container from docker runtime 

sudo docker rm d90
 

What is Azure container registory?

It is same as docker hub its a private version repositroy. 


Go to Azure container registory -> Access keys -> Enable Admin user then you can see username and password to connect to  container registory


Install Azure CLI in Linux 


To login to azure container registory 

az acr login --name registoryname --username uname --password 

login succeeded 

to tag our image on this container registory 

sudo docker tag sqlapp appregistory300030.azurecr.io/sqlapp(sqlapp is image name)

sudo docker push appregistory300030.azurecr.io/sqlapp



Azure Container instances	

Once we create an image then we need to create publish build of the application and copy that publish files into linux machine, then create a docker file end run the docker.

This can be simplified using container instances, once your image is ready map it with an instance then you have your image up and running, underlying infrastructre is managed for you. 

1. Provides a fast and easy way to deploy containers
2. This is managed instance, docker installation and configuration everything will be managed for you (underlying infrastructure)
3. ACI can also get their own public IP and DNS name 
4. You can also persist data via the use of azure file shares. 


Ceate Resource -> Container Instance -> 
Image source 
	* Quickstart images (Microsoft)
	* Azure Container Registry 
	* Other registry (from docker hub)
We can create image and its tag, which one we need . You needed to enable admin user in Azure container registory to access that in Container instances 

Networking Type -> public / Private 
Port -> 80 we are exposing on port 80. 

Review and create will create a container based on the image we gave.

Go to containers we can see state of the container, properties, logs etc. 


Multi Stage builds. 

Remember, the size of the image is based on the instruction we give to that image. For example in nginx image is lightweight. it will only have bare minimum things to serve as a web server will not have entire linux features. 

Similarly, if you see dotnet images, it will have dotnet runtime so it will be bigger in size. 



Instead of doing build and get publish version on our local and then port that to image we can give this as instruction to docker file 


FROM mcr.microsoft/dotnet/sdk:6.0 
WORKDIR /source  -- we are creating a working directory 
COPY *.csproj ./

COPY ..
RUN dotnet restore 

COPY .. 
RUN dotnet publish -c Release  -o out


 FROM  mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY..
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet","applicationname.dll"]



If we run this as it is. this will create layer by layers. we can create stages by doing this if that stage is done then it will remove that layer 


FROM mcr.microsoft/dotnet/sdk:6.0  AS build 
WORKDIR /source  -- we are creating a working directory 
COPY *.csproj ./

COPY ..
RUN dotnet restore 

COPY .. 
RUN dotnet publish -c Release  -o out  -- this step create an out folder without source folder


 FROM  mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /source/out .   -- we are copying out folder 
EXPOSE 80
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet","applicationname.dll"]




Azure container groups 


This is a collection of containers that get scheduled on the same host machine

Example, if we have two containers one for UI and one for backend 

The containers then share same lifecycle, resources, local network and storage volumes

The deployment of a container group is done via a Resource Manager template or a YAML file. 

you can persist data via the use of Azure file shares. 


3306 is port that will expose mysql 


sudo docker run --name=mysql-instance -p 3306:3306 --restart on-failure  -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Azure123 mysql (name of my image) 


sudo docker exec -it mysql-instance mysql -uroot -p
upon prompt give password. now you can see its connected to MySQL, you can run sql commands from putty itself


creating a custom image of mysql.. 

FROM mysql as base 
ENV MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=Azure123
ENV MYSQL_DATABASE=appdb
COPY 01.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/



1. We need to replace connection string server name with localhost for db. Because it will be hosted on same server. 

remove containers 

	i. sudo docker stop containername
	ii. sudo docker rm containername
remove images
	i. sudo docker images rm imagename

yaml file 

apiVersion: 2022-10-10
location: northeurope

properties: 
  containers: 
   properties:

Open Cloud shell

Advanced settings

File share, storage account - create new 

Upload yml file in cloud shell.. 


az container create --resource-group resourcegroupname --file deployment.yml


based on the above yml file, this container group will have two container instances


Implementing Azure security


Azure Active Directory? 

Azure Active directory is an identity provider and access management service.

Usage: This can be used as an identity provider for Azure, Microsoft 365 and other SaaS products as well. 

You can manage identities such as users, groups and even applications

Manage security aspects when it comes to your identities


Pricing 

Free - User and group management. 

Premium P1 - Dynamic groups, hybrid identities, self-service password reset for on-premise users.

Premium P2 - Azure AD identity protecion and privileged identity Management. 


Role Based Access control

A user or Application or Azure object first needs to authenticate itself to tell who it is and then role based authentication determine what that can access

Some Predefined roles are below

Contributor
Owner
Reader 


What is Application Object?

Lets say we want our application to access Storage account. We have two ways to achieve this
	1. save access keys of storage account in our application then application will authenticate itself
	2. We can create appilcation object and that object will be given some access then it will authenticate and access storage account. Advantage of using application object is that we can give multiple storage account access to our application objects. 


Microsoft Identity platform 

The platform helps to build applications that users and customers can sign in using their Microsoft identities or social accounts



Azure Active Directory -> App registrations -> New registration - > Enter name "BlobApp" and click Register 

Go to Storage account -> Access control -> Add role assignment -> Reader role -> Select member -> select "BlobApp" -> Review and assign


Go to Storage account -> Access control -> Add role assignment -> Storage Blob Data Reader role -> Select member -> select "BlobApp" -> Review and assign


We need couple of properties to connect with bolb now. 

Application / Client ID : Overview section of Application object
Tenant ID		: Overview section of Application object
Client secret		: Certificates and secrets  section of Application object 

Certificates and secrets -> Create new client secret -> Now you will see some secret please save it in secure place, once you navigate away you cannot see this again. 



String clientId ="";
string tenantId="";
string clientSecret="";

string blobUri="";
string filePath="c:/temp/";

ClientSecretCredentials clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredentials(tenantId, clientId, ClientSecret);
BlobClient blobClient = new BlobClient(new Uri(blobUri, ClientSecretCredentials );
await blobClient.DownloadToAsync(filepath);
console.WriteLine("The blob downloaded")
-- should instal Azure.Identity;



Microsoft Graph

Is an API https://graph.microsoft.com to provide access to rich, people-centric data and insights in the microsoft lcoud including Microsoft 365, Windows, and Enterprise Mobility + security. 

We are going to see how to invoke graph API using application object. In previous example, we were able to create application object and then on then blob storage account we give access control to that application object. 

But in order use this API using postman tool, postman is an external tool. For that we need to go application object -> API permissions 

By default Microsoft Graph -> User.Read (Delegated Type ) permission 

Types of Permission 
	1. Application Permission (Runs on behalf of the application)
	2. Delegated permission  (Runs on behalf of the user )

For our graph api we delete existing default permission and create application permission and -> User -> User.Read.All (Earlier it was User.Read)

Status -> Not granted for Default -> Click on Grant admin consent for Default Directory 


1. Register an application in Azure AD
2. Provide permissions
3. Provide Admin consent
4. Call the Microsoft authentication service
5. Get an access token
6. Accessa resource using the token 


how to get access key? 

Create a post request in postman. 

Go to postman application object -> Overview -> Oauth 2.0 token endpoint (v2)

Enter URL to postman 

Notice URL: https://login.microsoftonline.com/70c0xzy/oauth2/v2.0/token  -- after domain we see some random string this is directory 

x-www-form-urlencoded

Key               value
grand_type        client_credentials
client_id         from postman app object overview
client_secret     Create new secret from postman and copy here
scope             https://graph.microsoft.com/.default


Send- > 

Token type is Bearer token 


To access graph API

Create a get request from postman as below

Get : https:/graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users 

Headers

Authorization Bearer "Token copied from post request"

Note: even there is proper permission isn't provided also we can get permission from microsoft, but that token wont have permission to access your resources.



Update user

1. Add Users.Write.All permission
2. Add -> Click on Grant admin consent for Default Directory 
3. Generate token (to get updated permission
4. Make a patch call -> https:/graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/users/userid
5. Add header values with Authorization token 
6. Body -> Raw -> JSON {"givenName":"Username"}


Key Vault 

We have sensitive information like 
	* Encryption keys
	* Certificates
	* Secrets 

We need a safe way to store this, usually we need special software to store that and server to maintain that software.  

We have Azure Key vault

1. Create new key vault 
2. Go to Keys -> Create Generate Import Key 
3. Create new project 
4. Install Azure.Security.KeyVault.Keys
5. Create new app registration  
6. Appvault -> Access Policies -> Add Policy -> Key Permission (get, Encrypt, Decrypt)  
	Select Principal -> Keyapp -> Add -> Save 
Now this permission is 
tring clientId ="";
string tenantId="";
string clientSecret="";

string KeyVaultURL=""; -- from Keyvault overview section 
string keyName="appkey"; --name of your key in azure 
string textToEncrypt ="This is a secret text";

ClientSecretCredentials clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredentials(tenantId, clientId, ClientSecret);
KeyClient keyClient = new KeyClient(new Uri(keyVaultURL));

var key = keyClient.GetKey(keyName);
var cryptoClient = new CryptographyClient(key.Value.Id, clientSecretCredential );
byte[] textToBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(textToEncrypt);
EncryptResult result = cryptoClient.Encrypt(EncryptionAlgorithm.RsaOaep, textToBytes);
console.WriteLine("The Encrypted string ")
  
console.WriteLine(Convert.ToBase64String(result.Ciphertext));


byte[] cipherTOBytes = result.Ciphertext;
DecryptResult textDecrypted = cryptoClient.Decrypt(EncryptionAlgorithm.RsaOaep,cipherTOBytes )

console.WriteLine("The Decrypted string ")
console.WriteLine(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(textDecrypted.Plaintext);



Secrets 
======================================================

1. Install Azure.Security.KeyVault.Secrets


String clientId ="";
string tenantId="";
string clientSecret="";

ClientSecretCredentials clientSecretCredential = new ClientSecretCredentials(tenantId, clientId, ClientSecret);

string keyVaultUrl="";
string secretName ="dbConnectionString" -- secret name 
SecretClient secretClient = new SecreClient(new Uri(keyVaultUrl), clientSecretCredential)

var secret = secretClient.GetSecret(secretName );
string connectionString = secret.value.value;

In Azure, Secret should have Get permission. 


Managed Identities 

A common challenge for developers is the management of secrets, credentials, certificates, and keys used to secure communication between services. Managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage these credentials.

While developers can securely store the secrets in Azure Key Vault, services need a way to access Azure Key Vault. Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Azure Active Directory for applications to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) authentication. Applications can use managed identities to obtain Azure AD tokens without having to manage any credentials.


If you host your application on Azure VM, then you can make use of Managed identity, where you dont have to store anything including client secret, client ID etc. This managed identity will be given access to the azure resources. This works on azure services. If your application is hosted on outside Azure environment we can use Application object. 


1. Configure managed Identity for your VM , Go to VM -> Identity -> System assigned -> Status -> On -> Save 

(you can see this alert appvm will be registered with Azure Active directory. Once it is registered, appvm can be granted permissions to access resources protected by Azure AD. Do you want to enable the system assigned managed identity for appvm?)

2. Storage account -> Access control -> Add role assignment -> add memeber -> select appvm (which is our managed identity) 
3. TokenCredential will take access token from various places like Environment, ManagedIdentity, AzureCli, SharedTokenCache etc. 
4. Download RDP for VM, right click and edit -> Local Resources -> More -> Drives -> C:\   (so local C drive files are copied to VM ) 	  

string blobUri="";
string filePath="c:/temp/";
TokenCredential tokenCredential = new DefaultAzureCredential() 
 
BlobClient blobClient = new BlobClient(new Uri(blobUri, tokenCredential );
await blobClient.DownloadToAsync(filepath);
console.WriteLine("The blob downloaded")
-- should inclue azure.core



Managed Identitiy - Getting access token

We are going to use Metadata API to get the access token, this is the way to get access token from ManagedIdentity 

169.254.169.254




string token Uri = "http://169.254.169.254/metadata/identity/oauth2/token?api-version=2018-02-01&resource=http://storage.azure.com"

HttpClient client = new HttpClient ();
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("Metadata","true");
HttpRespoinseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(tokenUri);
string content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();

Dictionary<string, string> values = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Dictionary<string, string>(content);
foreach(KeyValuePari<string, string> pair in values)
{
Console.WriteLine("key "+ pair.Key);
Console.WriteLine("Value "+ pair.Value);
}


string BlobUri ="";
HttpClient BlobClient = new HttpClient();
BlobClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", values["access_token"]);
bolbClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add("x-ms-version","2017-11-09"); // To do a blob call, we need to provide mentioned information, refer microsoft documentation 
HttpRespoinseMessage blobresponse = await BlobClient.GetAsync(BlobUri );
string blobContent = await blobResponse.Content.ReadAsStringAsync(); 
console.WriteLine(content);




Azure Managed Identity

Instead of giving clientId, secret etc, we can make use of Managed Identity for Product Service project. 

App service -> Identity -> System Assigned -> on -> save 

In Azure keyvalue my connection string is saved. 
Key Vault -> Access Policies ->  Get access -> Select principal -> sqlapp (appservice name) ->save

 

Managed Identity Types

1. System Assigned (this is assigned on the resource itself, like VM, Resource group etc)
2. User Assigned (This is a seperate resource)

Use of User assigned identity is even when the resource is deleted this identity will stay. And we can assign one identity to multiple resources

You have to create managed identity and assign it to VM, then on the Storage account we need to give read and blob read permission to that managed identity. 



User Assinged Identity - Powershell
========================================

-- on terminal Install-Module Az.ManagedIdentity

Connect-AzAccount 

$ResourceGroupName="app-grp"
$IdentityName="app-identity"
$VmName ="appvm"


New-AzUserAssignedIdentity -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $IdentityName -Location "North Europe"

$Identity=Get-AzResource -Name $IdentityName -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName 
$Id=$Identity.Id 

$vm=Get-AzVm -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -name $VmName 
Update-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName  -VM $Vm -IdentityType UserAssigned -IdentityId $Id


Managed Identity - Powershell 
===========================================
Connect-AzAccount

$ResourceGroupName="app-grp"
$VmName="appvm"

$Vm=Get-AzVM -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -Name $VmName 

Update-AzVm -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -VM $vm -IdentityType SystemAssigned 


PowerShell - Storage Account 
===============================================

$StorageAccountName = "appstore5050"
$ResourceGroupName = "app-grp"

$StorageAccountKey= (Get-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName $ResourceGroupName -AccountName $StorageAccountName) | Where-Object {$_.KeyName -eq "key1"}

Set -AzKeyVaultSecret  -VaultName $KeyVaultName -Name $StorageAccountName -SecretValue $SecretValue

Section 10 
###########################################################
Implement Azure Security - Authentication and Authorization
===========================================================

Microsoft Identity Platform

Where Azure Active Directory is one of the Identity provider, we are not restricted to use only AAD. We can also make use of other external identity providers like Facebook, Gmail, LinkedIn etc

Basically we are going to get a token from external identity providers and provide access based on the token. 


Microsoft Authentication Library
--------------------------------

Enable developers to acquire access tokens from the Identity platforms
This can be used to authenticate users and allow secure access to APIs
It also maintains the token cache and refresh tokens when they are about to expire. 


OAuth2
==============================================================

An application is accessing some resource on behalf of the user is what OAuth is all about. This process is called Authorization work flow. 


oauth.net/2/ will have more information including grant types
	* Authorization code
	* PKCE
	* Client Credentials 
	* Device code
	* Refresh token


Click on client credentials you can notice what is required to make client credentials like grant_type 

POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.com
 
grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=xxxxxxxxxx
&client_secret=xxxxxxxxxx

This is what we followed when we use Azure Active directory


OAuth2 - Authorization Code Grant 
==============================================================


Resource Owner - This is the user who has access to the protected resource
Client		- This is the application requesting access to the resource  
Resource Server - In Azure, this can be Web API that will allow access into the Azure resource 
Authorization Server - Microsoft Identity platform is the authorization server 


How does Authorization code flow works?

1. Application makes a call to authorization server  and will provide callback URI to Authorization server. When  Authorization server has some response to provide it can use this call back uri
2. The authorization server sends the authorization code to the application. This authorization code is just the initial step in the process. The application then needs to use the authorization code to get the access token 
(Note the authorization code is viewable in the browser, but later in the process of getting the access token with the use of the authorization code is done by the application in the backend. This is for security reason to avoid man in middle attack) 




The Authorization Code Flow

Here’s each query parameter explained:

response_type=code - This tells the authorization server that the application is initiating the authorization code flow.
client_id - The public identifier for the application, obtained when the developer first registered the application.
redirect_uri - Tells the authorization server where to send the user back to after they approve the request.
scope - One or more space-separated strings indicating which permissions the application is requesting. The specific OAuth API you’re using will define the scopes that it supports.
state - The application generates a random string and includes it in the request. It should then check that the same value is returned after the user authorizes the app. This is used to prevent CSRF attacks.
When the user visits this URL, the authorization server will present them with a prompt asking if they would like to authorize this application’s request.



Use Authentication in Web project
============================================================

1. Create web app using .net core and add below configuration in appsettings.json
   "AzureAd": {
   "Instance" : "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
   "TenantId" : "",
   "ClientId" :""
  }
2. Install Microsoft.Identity.Web  
3. Program.cs -> builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(builder.Configuration)  // This will help us our application to authenticate itself automatically. 
app.UseAuthentication();
4. Index.cshtml.cs -> Add authorize attribute on class level
5. Go to Application object -> authenticaton -> Add platform -> Configure platform -> Enter the redirect URL 
Then Select the tokens you wold like to be issued by the authorization endpoint: -> ID tokens (used for implicit and hybrid flows)
6. Now our web application is asking us to login to Azure, lets provide credentials and login 
7. Now browser is asking permissions requested. (consent on behalf of your organization) 
Remember, in application object we gave "Grant admin consent for default directory". This is because postman has no ability to get this consent (we are not logged in as azure user account). But this case we did not enabled it, so our application is prompting user permission 
Another important point is postman is having application Type permission, means our postman itself should have permission. In this case we have delegated permission, means on user's behalf application will authorize. 

After giving our consent we are getting below error. The redirect URI https://localhost:7046/signin-oidc specified in  THE REQUEST DOES NOT MATCH THE REDIRECT UriS CONFIGURED FOR THE APPLICATION 


"AzureAd": {
   "Instance" : "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
   "TenantId" : "",
   "ClientId" :""
   "CallbackPath": "/signin-oidc"
   "SignedOutCallbackPath": "/signout-oidc"

  }

the same has to be configured Authentication section of Application object
Redirect URL
https://localhost:7046/signin-oidc
Front Channel logout url 
https://localhost:7046/signout-oidc

oidc - OpenIDConnect We are using OpenIdConnect to authenticate then Oauth to authorize. 



Adding Sign-out 
===========================================================

1. For sign-in and sign-out we need to use the following library Microsoft.Identity.Web.UI
2. builder.Services.AddControllersWithViews()
3. Place AddRazorPages below with opions

builder.Services.AddRazorPages().AddMvcOptions(options => 
{
var policy = new AuthorizationPolicyBuilder()
	.RequireAutheticatedUser()
	.Build();
	options.Filters.Add(new AuthorizeFilter(policy));
)}.AddMicrosoftIdentityUI();

// add required library using if error is popping up 

4. Remove Authorize attribute, because we are now going to use authenticated users only 
5. app.UseEndpoints(endpoings => 
endpoints.MapControllerRoute(
name: "default",
pattern: "{controller=Nome}/{action=Index}/{id?}"))

6. Add new Scaffolded Item -> Go to Identity (it will add default nuget packages that are necessary for this) ->  Choose Account\Login  and Account\Logout -> Click on Add new Data context class ->  Add SQLLite instead on SQL server. 

7. Areas -> Identity -> Data (AuthAppContext) 
		     -> Pages -> Account (Login and logout.cshtml) 
8. Program.cs also sqllite configuration and identity configuration will be added. 
9. To signout  asp-area="MicrosoftIdentity" asp-controller="Account "  asp.action="SignOut" 


Getting user claims?

Claims is nothing but information about users. 
In authentication we enabled ID tokens through which we will get information about users. 

@using System.Security.Claims

@foreach(var _claim in ((ClaimsIdentity) User.Identity).Claims)
{

<tr>
<td>@_claim.Type</td>
<td>@_claim.Value</td>
</tr>
}



Getting Group claims 
============================================================

We can create groups, add members. and give access to that group, so that whoever assigned to that group get same level of permission 

If application need certain role to access the application then the application can check what group user is assigned to and get their role based on that. 

To do that go to AuthApp -> TokenConfiguration -> Add Group claim  -> Select group types to include in Access, ID and SAML tokens -> select "Security groups"
 
Customize token properties by type -> ID -> Group ID (is default )
				      Access -> Group ID  -> Add


Go to Manifest section (it is a json file having information about our cliam) go and check groupMembershipClaims : "SecurityGroup" 

No in our claim program we should have got this group ID . We can make note of group ID which we are looking for and take action based on it. 

Apart from that we can also Add optional claim -> ID -> email, givenname
Turn on the Microsoft graph email, profile permission(required for claims to appear in token)  


Getting An Access token.
===============================================================

1. Lets say we want out applicationto access storage account to perform some action

But now, we are authenticating user and giving users permission to access storage account, but application need certain permission to access storage account. 

1. To do that API permissions ->  Add permission -> Azure storage -> Delegated permission (only this is possible) -> Permission -> user_impersonation (application will act like user and get permission to access storage account) 
2. Also Authentication -> Access tokens (used for implicit flows) 

3. program.cs 

string[] scope = new string[] {"https://storage.azure.com/user_impersonation"}
builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebAppAuthentication(builder.Configuration, "AzureAd")
		.EnableTokenAcquisitionToCallDownstreamApi(scope);
		.AddInMemoryTokenCaches();
Now we are getting token from application like below

private readonly ITokenAcquisition _tokenAcquistion;
public string accessToken;

public IndexModel(ITokenAcquisition tokenacqu)
{
_tokenAcquistion = tokenacqu
}

public Task OnGet()
{
string[] scope = new string[] {"https://storage.azure.com/user_impersonation"}
accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(scope)
}


Not its showing error  "MsalClientException: One client credential type required either: ClientSecret, Certificate OR clientAssertion must be defined when creating a confidential client. ONly specify one. 

Go to appsetting.json

"ClientSecret" : "secretfromAzure"



Using Access Token 
====================================================================================================


 public Task OnGet()
{
//string[] scope = new string[] {"https://storage.azure.com/user_impersonation"}
//accessToken = await _tokenAcquisition.GetAccessTokenForUserAsync(scope)

TokenAcquisitionTokenCredential tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential = new TokenAcquisitionTokenCredential(_tokenAcquisition);
Uri blobUri = new Uri("");
BlobClient blob = new BlobClient(blobUri, tokenAcquisitionTokenCredential );


MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream(ms);
blobContent = sr.ReadToEnd();

}

--install Azure.Storage.Blobs from nuget package. 

Now we can get blobcontent to our web application..

In order to publish to Azure web app, we need to update sign in and signout properties in Application object with new web app url. 


Publish as Zip option.  


Accessing Blob storage from Postman

1. Select Storage account and give access to postman application object with reader and blob read access
2. Goto Postman and in the token post request change the scope alone with below
https://storage.azure.com/default 
3. Send will get us the access token 
4. Go to storage account we will get bolburi
5. When we give access token in the header section we will get contents from azure blob. 



Creating web api & Publish is normal process. Then add authentication 
=============================================================
1. Go to manifest -> accessTokenAcceptedVersion -> change null to 2 . 2 means supporting oauth2.0 , null means oauth. 

2. In project install Microsoft.Identity.Web from nuget 
3. Program.cs -> builder.Services.AddMicrosoftIdentityWebApiAuthentication(builder.Configuration,"")


3. In appsettings.json -> add AzureAd section with clientid, TenantId, Instance details
4. App.userAuthentication() and App.UseAuthorization();
5. Now accessing URL will give 401 error 
(as our postman tool cannot login as user, we need to create an application object for API project ProductAPI)
6. Go to "Expose an API " -> Application ID URI -> SET -> will populate one api(scopes defined by this API . Define custom scopes to restrict access to data and functionlaity protected by the API. An applicationthat requires access to parts of this API can request that a user or admin consent to one or more of these.
Adding a scope here creates only delegated permissoins. If you are looking to create application-only scopes, use 'App roles' and define app roles assignable to application type. Go to app roles. 
7. Copy the api and paste it in scope when getting access token 

8. GO to post man -> API permission ->  select our Produt API -> Application permission (we have this ) -> Permissions -> ProductAccess -> Add permission -> Add Admin consent	  
 
Go to Product API application object and Add roles ->  
  


Invoking API from console application 


IcConfidentialClientApplication cca ;

string clientid="";
string clientSecret="";
string tenantId = "";

cca = ConfidentialClientApplication.Create(clientId)
	.WithTnenatId(tenantId)
	.WithClientSecret(clientSecret)
	.Build();

string[] scopes = new string[] {"api/xy/.default"} 
AuthenticationResult result = await cca.AcquireTokenForClient(scope).ExecuteAsync();
 
string accessTOken = result.AccessToken;
Console.WriteLine(accessToken);

string apiURL="WebAPI url";

HttpCLient client = new HttpClient();
client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer" , accessToken );


HttpResponseMessage responseMessage = await client.SendAsync(apiUrl);
string content = await resonpseMessage.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();


Section 11
############################################################

Azure Monitor
===========================================================

Search -> Monitor -> Metrics -> select any resource and apply (we can see many metrics types, 
	* CPU credits Consumed
	* CPU credits Remaining
	* Available Memory Bytes
	* Data Disk Bandwidth Consumed percentage
	* Data Disk IPOs Consumed Percentage
	* Data Disk Max Burst Bandwidht etc 
We can save it to Dashboard 


Activity Log -> This will have administrative activities are recorded here. 


Configure alerts
==============================================================

1.   Select scope (This is choosing your resource - VM for example)
2.  -> Condition (selecting your condition, ex CPU % reach 70 # 
      Signal type ->  (All, Metrics, Log, Activity Log)	 -> Metrics -> Network -> 
		alert logic -> Static -> Threshold value 100 B

Evaluated based on Aggregation granularity 5 mins, Frequency of evaluation 5 mins
3. Actions -> Create new action group -> 
				Notification type -> Email/SMS message/Push / Voice  -> Give your email id 
				
4. Details -> Severity (Informational)	
				Actions -> 	

5. After 5 mins -? there will be new alert logged in alerts section. 


Dynamic thresholds

Azure Monitor uses machine learning to check the historical behavior or metrics. 

Based on the historical data, it can then identify patterns and anomalies that could indicate possible issues. 

Sensitivity 

High - Here the alert rule will be triggered even for the smallest deviation.

Medium - you have more balanced threshold and fewer alerts will be generated

Low- alerts will only triggered on large deviation. 


Select resource-> Condition -> CPU % -> Threshold -> Dynamic -> Threshold sensitivity -> Medium 



Log analytics
==================================================================

Central solution for all of your logs


Create resource -> Log Analytics -> Create -> 

How to connect your VM into log analytics

VM -> connect -> Extentions + applications -> microsoftmonitoringagent is being installed -> this agent will be sending logs to microsoft based vm 
for linux it will be OmsAgentForLinux. 

Agent Configuration ->  
	* Windows event logs
	* Windows performance counters
	* Linux performance counter 
	* Syslog 
	* IIS logs 

you need to wait for 20 mins to 30 mins to see the logs reflecting 

Analytics -> Logs -> LogManagement -> Heartbeat (is already created)

based on the log you configured, that table will be created. 

1. Add windows event log -> Logname -> Application -> Error, warning, information 
2. syslog -> Add facility -> syslog -> Emergency, alert, Critical , Error, Warning, Notice, Info, Debug etc. 



Azure Web app - Diagnostic 

Web app-> Diagnostic settings -> We can collect  (AppServiceHTTPLogs, AppServiceCOnsoleLogs, AppServiceAppLogs, AppServiceAuditLogs etc) 	
Destination -> Send to Log Analytics workspace

What is Application Insights?

	* This provides the feature of application performance managment and monitoring of live web applications - Monitoring
	* You can see aspects such as detecting performance issues or any other Issues - Aspects
	* Support for .Net, node.js, java and python. 
	* This works for application hosted in Azure, on-premises environments or other cloud platforms
	* It has Integration with the Visual studio IDE 

How it works ? 

You can install a small instrumentation package (SKD) for your application or use the application insights agent. 

You can instrument web applications background components and javascript in web pages .

The telemetry data sent by application Insights has very little impact on the perfromance of your application. 

In Nuget packages we can see that Appinsight is deprecated, we need to use latest stable version to get rid of this issue. 



Application Insights on Azure
===============================================================

Go to Web app -> Turn on Application Insights -> Enable -> Create New rosource (this will create new application insight ) -> We need to select Log analytics workapace also -> Go to .net core and select different  aspects -> Recommended -> Profiler (On)  , Snapshot debugger (on) , SQL commands (ON) 


Click on connected services -> remove SDK dependency and save. But we are going to keep telemetry code in program.cs because we need this line to use azure application insights. but SDK is not required on cloud. 


Once published to cloud you can see new app insight resource is created -> Live metrics -> We can see incoming and outgoing requests. 


Performance data - Application Insights
===================================================================

App insights -> Performance tab -> We can see time taken for that request and we can also see dependent request etc from this performance tab. 

To view the sql script executed we can use the following code

builder.Services.ConfigureTelemetryModule<DependencyTrackingTelemetry>((module,o) => {module.EnableSqlCommandTextInstrumentation = true;});

Right click on the project -> Configure application insigts -> Application Insights SDK (local) or Azure Application insights -> Next -> It will install nuget packages and code dependency will be added 

This step will install Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.dotnetcore and program.cs will have builder.Services.AddApplicationInsightsTelemetry();

Run your application -> View -> Other Windows -> Application Insights search -> Search debug session telemetry -> Search we can see different types of events. 


Application Insights -> Users, Sessions and Events

=============================================================================

Users - Here you can see how many people have used your applicationand its features.

Session - You can see sessions of user activity. This includes certain pages and features of the application. 

Events - This gives a view of how often certain pages and featres have been used in the application. 

Funnels - Here you can have multiple stages like a pipeline and then you can see how users are progressing through your application as an entire process

Cohorts - This is set of users, sessions, events or operations that have something in common. It helps to analyze a particular set of users or events. 

Impact - Here you can see how load times and other aspects of your application impact the conversion rate for your application. 

Retention - You can analyze how many users return back to your application. 

User flows- This can help in answering useful questions such as 	
	1. What do users click on a page within the applicaiton 
	2. Where are the places within the application that users chrun the most from the site. 
	3. Are there places in the application where the users repeat the same action over and over again. 


Application Insights - Availablity Tests
==============================================================

Tests - You can define tests that can monitor the availability and responsiveness of an application 
Web Requests - This feature can send web requests to your web application from different points across the world. 
End point - You can setup tests against an HTTP or HTTPS endpoint that's accessible over the public internet
API - You can also test your REST API's as well 

Go to application Insights -> Availability -> Add Standad (preview) test ->  Test URL (app service URL ) (Parse dependent requests -- this wil test for dependent resources like image etc).

Test Frequency  -> 5 mins , Test location . Lets test after 20 mins. 

This is automated test for your we application availability. 

Application Insights - Tracking Users 
===================================================

Now we can see that under app insights Sessions -> Users -> Authenticared user -> we can see undefined in the authenticated users. 


To log authenticated user -> Create a class "TelemetryServices.cs" ->  inherit from TelemetryInitializerBase class 



public TelemetryService(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor) : base(httpContextAccessor){
}

protected override void OnInitializeTelemetry(HttpContext platformContext, RequestTelemetry)
{
telemetry.Context.User.AuthenticatedUserId = platformContext.User?.Identity.Name ?? string.Empty 	


}
Optimizing Content Delivery 
============================================================
Frequently accessed data can be saved on Redis cache for better performance. 


Azure Redis Cache

Data store: This is an in-memory data store that is based on the Redis software

Server memory : Here you can store frequently accessed data in server memory. 

Advantage : the advantage of server memoery is tht you can write and read data quickly. 

For the application: It helps to provide low latency to your data and high throughput

Data cache
------------------------------------------------------------

1. We are taking very frequently accessed data from source (Azure SQL or any possible datasource) and then store it in Azure Cache for Redis then 
our application directly accessing from Redis cache. Keep in mind that Redis cache and Azure SQL database wont know each other. They wont in sync, unless it is ensured by the web application. Its web apps responsibility. 



Content cache
---------------------------------------------------------------
We store header footer and static content in the cache. 


Session Store
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Cart item can be stored in cache. 



Go to Azure Cache -> Console 

Set top:course:rating 4.9
get top:course:rating 
exists top:course:rating -- Integer(1) means yes, integer(0) means no. 
del top:3:course


lpush top:3:courses "az-104"
lpush top:3:courses "az-204"
lpush top:3:courses "az-304"

leNFW ROP:3:COURSES 0-1



Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure 

======================================================

Install StackExchange.Redis package from Nuget package. 

string connection ="connectionstring from azure for redis cache"

ConnectionMultiplexer redis = ConnectingMultiplexer.Connect(connectionString);
Void SetCacheData()
{
IDatabase database = redis.GetDatabase();

database.StringSet("top:3:courses", "az104,az-204,az-304");
console.writeline("cache data has been set");
}


Void getCacheData()
{
IDatabase  db = redis.GetDatabase();
if(db.KeyExists("top:3:courses")){
console.WriteLine(db.StringGet("top:3:courses"));
else
Console.WriteLine("Key does not exist");
}
}
	


Key Evection


We need to ensure that the cache does not fill up. 

Ensure that the cache does not have stale data. There is a default policy in place to evict keys that is LRU (least recently used) 

We can refer which key eviction policy is suitable for our situation 

noeviction: New values aren’t saved when memory limit is reached. When a database uses replication, this applies to the primary database
allkeys-lru: Keeps most recently used keys; removes least recently used (LRU) keys
allkeys-lfu: Keeps frequently used keys; removes least frequently used (LFU) keys
volatile-lru: Removes least recently used keys with the expire field set to true.
volatile-lfu: Removes least frequently used keys with the expire field set to true.
allkeys-random: Randomly removes keys to make space for the new data added.
volatile-random: Randomly removes keys with expire field set to true.
volatile-ttl: Removes keys with expire field set to true and the shortest remaining time-to-live (TTL) value.


SetKeyExpiry(string key, TimeSpan expiry)
{

IDatabase database = redis.GetDatabase();
database.KeyExpire(key, expiry);
Console.WriteLine("Set the key expire to 30 seconds");



Use Redis cache in Web application
---------------------------------------------------------

1. Install StackExchange.Redis nuget package
2. Connecting string in project
3. use multiplexer class to connect with Redis cache. 
4. Add Multiplexer and Produce service dependencies
5. 

public async Task<List<Product>> GetProducts()
{
List<Product> _product_list = new List<Product>();
IDatabase database = _redis.GetDatabase();
string key ="productList";
if(await database.KeyExistsAsync(key))
{
long listLength = database.ListLength(key);
for(int 1=0; i<listLenght;i++)
{
string value = database.ListGetByIdent(key, i);
for (int i=0;i<listLenght;i++){
string value = database.ListGetByIndex(key, i);
Product product = JsonConvert.DeserializeOject<pRODUCT>(VALUE);
_product_list.Add(product);
}
return _product_list;
 else {

string sql ="select * from Products";
SqlConnection conn = new SqlConnection();
con.Open();

SqlCOmmand cmd = new SqlCommand(sql,con);
using (SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader())
{
while(reader.Read())
{
Product _product = new Product()
{
ProductId = reader.GetInt32(0),
ProductName = reader.GetString(1),
Quantity = _reader.GetInt32(2)
};
database.ListRightPush(keh, JsonConvert.SerializeObject(_product));
_prodcut_lst.Add(_product);

}
con.close();
return _product_lst;
}

}


What is Azure Content Delivery?
==============================================================

CDN profile is created at global level.. 

And end point will be pointing to web application 


1. The user in the East US location makes a request to the CDN endpoint
2. The CDN checks whether the point of presence location closest  to the user has the requested file 
3. If not a request is made to the source to get the required file
4. A server in the point of present location will then cache the required file
5. The server will also send the file to the user
 

CDN
=====================================================

All resources -> Create resource -> Front Door and CDN profiles -> Create -> Explore other offerings -> Azure CDN standard from Verizon ->  This resource is Global level  -> Create End point ->  name will be appended with .azureedge.net -> OrginType (Web app)   -> orgin host name (Web app_

4 - 5 mins to take effect -> 

After deployment of resource we can see Endpoint in CDN profile -> Click on the endpoint we can see 

Origin hostname : webapp url
Endpoint Hostname : CDN url, this one we need to share it to client . This will load the website with CDN support 


CDN caching 
=========================================================

We need to refresh the CDN if the data is changing

CDN profile -> Endpoint -> caching rules -> Default cache expiration duration is 7 days by default

Caching behavior -> Override -> Set expiration to 1 mins for demo purpose
	* Bypass cache
	* Override
	* Set if missing 
	* Not set 


After doing that we need to first purge the cache. Then wait for 1 mins we can see the data is in sync. 


Azure Front door
===================================================================
Azure Front door is another content deliver tool and it has more features. 

1. Content delivery
2. Web application firewall is there to protect your application. 
3. We can route traffic based on certain criteria


We are creating two web apps and put them behind Azure front door. 

Go to WebApp -> App service editor-> create basic HTML file. (we can directly do some changes here)

Create new resource -> Front Door and CDN profile -> Tier (standard) Endpoint -> specify name , Orgin type (app service) > Orgin host name (select web app) -> WAF (Web application Firewall policy) 

Now Azure Front door is entry point front facing for user, based on condition we can route user to different server / application 


Azure Front door -> Front door manager -> Routes -> Edit Origin group -> Add another orgin -> name , origin type, Hostname (another wep app) .. Now both webapps are having same priority and same weightage. we need to wait for 10 mins 

If we access web endpoint of front door, we are landing in UK south, even though we have same priority to both web apps. Reason is UK south has low latency from my current location. we can check this on azure speed.com.  Azure front door will identify which one is best then redirect there. 


Caching - You can enable caching your endpoint routes

When delivering large files, Azure Front Door request the file from the origin in chunks of 8 MB
When a chunk of data is received, the data chunk is cached and immediately sent to the user. 

you have different query string behaviors when it comes to caching. 

Ignore query strings - Here the query strings from the requestor is passed to the origin for the first request and then the asset is cached. All further requests ignore the query strings until the expiry of the cached asset. 
Cache every Unique URL - Here each URL is treated as unique and cached separately. 
Specify cache key query string  - you can decide to include/ exclude specified parameters to determine what gets cached. 

Compressing is possible. 


Tools
=============================================================

Powershell 
-----------------

Powershell is an engine where we can run various commands to work with different services. It can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux distributions. Azure powershell is a section which will handle azure based resources. 

Powershell provides command line shell, script language and configuration network

Powershell has the ability to work with .Net objects. 

cmdlets - these are powershell commands. 


Install powershell
-----------------------------------------------------------

In windows machine, powershell is preinstalled

get version "$PSVersionTable"   

Install Azure Az Powershell module. 
0. Open Powershell in admin mode 
1. Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
2. Install-Module -Name Az -Scope CurrentUser -Repository PSGallery -Force (in case of error use -AllowClobber) 
ARM Templates are resource as code
3. After instalation Connect-AzAccount this will prompt credentials in browser upon successful log we can get Account, tenant and Subscription ids in Powershell. 


Azure Powershell using visual studio code. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Open VS code -> Extensions -> Install
	* Powershell
	* Azure powershell 

Create new file -> Select language (default python, we can change to powershell. As soon as you change Powershell you can notice terminal starts PS /home/project (whatever your current directory ) 

Create 3 folders Azure web app -> Script.ps1


$ResourceGroupName="powershell-grp" 
$Location="North Europe"
$AppServicePlanName="companyplan200"
$WebAppName="companyapp90999"

Connect-AzAccount

Azure CLI
=============================================================

Azure CLI is available in Mac, Linux and Windows

Install Azure cli for your respoective OS and to go command prompt and enter 

"az login" -> prompted to give credentials once done your detail will be fetched on the CLI


 Few CLI commands


//1.  create app service plan 

az appservice plan create --name azcliplan100 --resource-group docker-grp --is-linux  //--is-linux  check is underlying machine is for linux 

//2. Create Web app

az webapp create --resource-group docker-grp --plan azcliplan100 --name dockerapp55000 --deployment-container-image-name appregistry30030.azurecr.io/webapp:latest

//3. If you want to turn on container logging

az webapp log config --name dockerapp55000 --resource-group docker-grp --docker-container-logging filesystem

//4. Enable the log stream 

az webapp log tail --name dockerapp55000 --resource-group docker-grp 


Azure CLI - Azure Kubernetes 
=============================================================
Azure Cloud shell - this terminal can execute both Powershell scripts and Azure cli commands 

Powershell may be prompted to you for admin rights, so if you dont have admin rights then you can go for the Azure cloud shell, it will be operate based on Azure logged in credentials. 

Please note it requires Azure storage account. 

1. Create resource group
	* az group create --name kubernetes-grp --location northeurope
2. Az aks create --resource-group kubernetes-grp --name appcluster --node-count 1 --enable-addons monitoring --generate-ssh-keys
	// aks will create Azure Kubernetes services . Please wait for 5 mins for the step 2 to complete 
3. kubectl tool is inbuild with kubernetes (kubectl is included with Azure cloud shell) . To install in your local machine az aks install-cli

4. Get credentials so that kubectl tool can interact with aks 
	az aks get-credentials --resource-group kubernetes-grp --name appcluster
5. kubectl get notes

6. We can deploy yaml files we created when work with containers. deploy and service.yml files 

kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
kubectl apply -f service.yml 

7. After this commands, you can go to appcluster -> workloads -> nginx deployment  and go to services and ingresses -> nginxservice in place. 

8. Delete resource group - az group delete --name kubernetes-grp 


ARM templates 
========================================================================

1. Infrastructure as code. 

sample ARM template 

"resources": [
  {
    "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
    "apiVersion": "2019-04-01",
    "name": "mystorageaccount",
    "location": "westus",
    "sku": {
      "name": "Standard_LRS"
    },
    "kind": "StorageV2",
    "properties": {}
  }
]


Create ARM from VS code
------------------------------------------------------------

1. Extension -> search arm template 	ARM tools 
2. Select language - > JSON -> type Arm (as we have already installed ARM tools we will get basic template 
3. New-AzResourceGroupDeployment -ResourceGroupName app-grp -TemplateFile template.json
4. "copy":{
"name":"storagecopy",
"count":3
}

this command will create 3 instances having same configuration as mentioned in the resources. However we need to give unique name for the storage account. for that we can use the below expression 
"name": "[concat(copyIndex(),'appstore444444')]


ARM Template - Azure Virtual Machine 
=============================================

Create resource -> Click Virtual machine -> Edit template -> (this will give all information needed, we can edit and use that ARM 

location: "[resourceGroup().location]"

we have dependsOn property. It will say particular property is dependsOn another, for example Network interface is depend on PublicIpaddress and virtual networks. This is important azure is not going to follow the order we created json property. So it is important to mention depends on 




Section 7
########################################################################################################

Azure Storage  
==================================================================

There are different types of Storage account. If you create general purpose v2 , we can create
	* Blob (Large objects images, videos etc)
	* Table (store table data)
	* Queue (storign queues, used for sending and receiving messages)
	* File (used for file shares)


Account tyes
==================================================================

1. Standard General purpose v2
	This is standard storage for blobs, file shares, queues and tables
2. Premium block blobs
	This is supported for block and append blobs. This is when you want fast access to your blobs, high transaction rates
3. Premium page blobs
	This used to store virtual harddisk for azure VM . This is when you want to fast access to your blobs high transaction rates
4.Premium file shares
	If you want fast access to your files 


Different types of blobs

	* Block blobs  (blocks of data that can be managed individually)
	* Append Blobs (These block blobs are optimized for append operation, good for logging)
	* Page blobs (Virtual hard drive files )

Upload a blob 
=============================================================
1. We need to create a container then we can upload any file
2. Upload -> Browse -> Select files ->open -> upload -> Edit (there are selected formats that can open, pdf it will not open)
3. By default it will create Block Blob 
4. Upload a folder (this will first create a folder then create files into that 
5. Data lake Gen 2 , this will create folder structure in place

Accessing blob
=================================================================
1. If you copy paste blob url and execute in the browser, you can see you not authorized error. It is private and not available for ananymous access
2. One way to enable access is(not recommended way) Change access level -> 
	* Private (no anonymous access)
	* BLob (anaonymous read access for blobs only)
	* Container (anonymous read access for containers and blobs) 
3. If we give option 2 or 3 now you can access blob. 

Different Authorization methods
=====================================================================
1. Access Keys
2. Shared Access Signatures
3. Azure Active Directory


Using Azure Storage explorer
=========================================================================
Install this free tool from internet -> launch it.  If we login, under our subscription we can see storage account and blob container. 


If we provide the access key for the storage account then the user is having full access to the storage account. 



Shared Access Signature
=================================================================================
1. Click on any object in storage account -> Generate SAS -> 
	* Signing Key -> Key 1 / Key 2 - its going to use any one key to generate SAS key. 
Permission -> Read 
Start and end time we can configure 
Allowed IP addresses -> 
Allowed protocol -> HTTPS only
Generate SAS token and URL 

Blob SAS token and
Blob SAS URL is generated 

If we copy SAS URL then we can see the azure blob file using SAS token. 



SAS at account level 
=======================================================================
We have more option now when we check SAS at the account level 


Allowed services

Blob File Queue Table - we can check as required

Allowed resource types
Services  container object - as required

Allowed Permissions
Read Write Delete List Add Create Update Process Immutable storage 

Blob Versioning permission
Enables Deletion of versions

Allowed blob index permissoin 

Read/Write Filter 


If we try to access the SAS token we cannot access it, as it will have to access whole storage account, not single file . So instead of browser we need to use Azure Storage Explorer

We can only see what we have access to see. I have given only blob then only blob storage will be visible in storage explorer 


Stored Access Policy 
=======================================================================

If SAS is compromised and wrong people get to know it then we need to invalidate. We have access policy

1. Access Policy -> Add policy -> "ReadPolicy(AnyUserName)" save this. 

2. Go to Azure Storage explorer -> Storage account -> Container -> Get Shraed Access policies -> Access Policy -> Select our ReadPolicy ->  Create -> now you will get URL -> copy 

3. Add Account -> Blob container -> SAS -> Paste URL here 

4. If you want to revoke the access you can go to the Access policy and remove the permission. 


Different types of SAS

1. Account SAS
2. Service SAS
3. User delegation SAS


Storage Accounts  - Active Directory Authentication
====================================================================

1. Create User in AD
2. Assing role assignment with storage account and -> IAM -> give Storeage account contributor 


Azure Storage account  - Pricing Tiers


All prices are per GB per month.

Premium	Hot	           Cool	                 Archive
First 50 terabyte (TB) / month	$0.15 per GB	$0.018 per GB	$0.01 per GB	$0.00099 per GB
Next 450 TB / month	$0.15 per GB	$0.0173 per GB	$0.01 per GB	$0.00099 per GB
Over 500 TB / month	$0.15 per GB	$0.0166 per GB	$0.01 per GB	$0.00099 per GB


Hot is default access tier. 
Cool - accessed infrequently stored for at least 30 days 
Archive - Rarely accessed and stored for at least 180 days 

Hot and cold is enabled for storage account level and archive is enabled for Blob level . 



Hot ,Cool access tiers 
===========================================================

Storage account -> Configuration settings -> Blob access tier -> Can change it to Hot and cool. 

Archieve access tier. 
=============================================================

Setting the access tier to "Arhive" will make your blob inaccessible unitl it is rehydrated back to "Hot" or "Cool" which may take several hours. 

If you change your blob item to Archive then you cannot see that item listed in the container of storage account. You need to change the access tier again. 

There you can set the rehydrate priority to 
	* Standard or
	* High (this means faster rehydrate and higher cost) 


Life cycle management policies
==================================================================
If we feel we are using some objects less frequently then we can change it to Cool or archive access tier, but it is tidius to do that every single item. There is efficient way to do that. 

Through some rules we can tell Azure to change access tier for an object or even delete object. 

Life cycle Management 
----------------------
1. Transition - YOu can transition blobs from the cool to host access tier to save on storage cost 
2. You can transition blobs, blob versions and blob snapshots   
3. You can also define rules to delete blobs, blob versions and blob snapshots
4. Rules can be applied at the storage account level or to a subset of blobs. 

Rules filter - you can define filters for blobTypes - blockBlob, appendBlob
Rule actions - You have actions such as tierToCool, tierToArchive and delete 
Support - Rules are supported for blob and append blobs in general0purpose v2 accounts, Premium Block Blob and Blob Storage accounts. 
Regions - this feature is available in all regions. 

How to do that?
---------------------------------

Storage account -> Data management -> Lifecycle management -> Add rule -> Ally rule to all bobs in your storage account / Limit Blobs with filters. 
Blob type -> Block blobs/ Append blobs
Blob subtype -> Base blobs/snapshots/versions

Base blobs were Last modified More than (days ago) -> 30 -- any value we can set
Then Move to cool storage 


Note on the Rehydrate time 
=========================================================
Rehydration priority
When you rehydrate a blob, you can set the priority for the rehydration operation via the optional x-ms-rehydrate-priority header on a Set Blob Tier or Copy Blob operation. Rehydration priority options include:

Standard priority: The rehydration request will be processed in the order it was received and may take up to 15 hours to complete for objects under 10 GB in size.
High priority: The rehydration request will be prioritized over standard priority requests and may complete in less than one hour for objects under 10 GB in size.


Azure Blob versioning 
===============================================================

Versions - Allow to keep previous versions of a blob
Restore - You can then restore an earlier version of the blob
Version Id - Each blob gets an initial version ID. A new version is set whenever the blob is updated
Feature Enable - You can enable or disable the feature at any point of time 


Storage Account -> Data management -> Data protection -> Tracking -> Enable versioning for blobs 

Blob Snapshots
=====================================================================
Note: If we disable versioning for an storage account still the versions of the file will not be removed. 
Storage accounts -> Data protections -> Snapshots (Take a copy /snapshot of file  at that particular point of time. ) 
Click on the snapshot -> Promote snapshot -> this will resotre the snapshot as current version. 


Soft Delete 
==============================================================
Retention - You can specifiy a retention period for deleted objects, this is betweeen 1 - 365 days. 
Availability  - Depending on the retention period, the data will be made available after it has been deleted or overwritten 
Restore - During the retention period, you can restore a deleted blob along with its snapshots
Change - You can change retention any time. 

Storage account -> Data protections -> Enable soft delete for blobs -> 7 days is enabled by delete. 
Delete the blob file -> Click on the switch "Show delete blobs" -> right most . . . -> Undelete  


Creating containers 
================================================================

1. Create console project based on .net 6. -> Install Azure.Storage.Blobs -> 
2. Program.cs -> 
string connectionString ="constrfromAzureStoreAccount";
string containerName ="DesiredContainerName";
BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(connectionString);
await blobServiceClient.CreateBlobContainerAsync(containerName); // we can specify second parameter as public access type Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models.PublicAccessType.Blob/BlobContainer/None 
Console.WriteLine("Container created");

.NET -Uploading a blob 
====================================================================

string connectionString ="constrfromAzureStoreAccount";
string containerName ="DesiredContainerName";

string blobName="script.sql ";
string filePath="c:\\temp\\script.sql"
BlobContainerClient blobServiceClient = new BlobContainerClient(connectionString, containerName); // we are directly connecting to Container of storage account 
BlobClient blobClient= blobServiceClient.GetBlobClient(blobName); 
await BlobClient.UploadAsync(filePath, true); // true is override flag, if it exists already. 
Console.WriteLine("Container Updated ");


.NET -list the blob 
====================================================================
Using Azure.Storage.Blobs;

string connectionString ="constrfromAzureStoreAccount";
string containerName ="DesiredContainerName";

BlobContainerClient blobContainerClient = new BlobContainerClient(connectionString, containerName); // we are directly connecting to Container of storage account 

await foreach(BlobItem bi in blobContainerClient.GetBlobsAsync )
{
Console.WriteLine("The Blob Name is {0}", blobItem.Name);
Console.WriteLine("The Blob size is {0}", blobItem.Properties.ContentLength ); // size will ne in bytes 


}
  
.NET - Download a blob 
====================================================================
Using Azure.Storage.Blobs;

string connectionString ="constrfromAzureStoreAccount";
string containerName ="DesiredContainerName";

string blobName="script.sql ";
string filePath="c:\\temp\\script.sql"
BlobClient blobClient= new BlobClient(connectionString, ContainerName, blobname); 
await.blobClient.DownloadToAsync(filePath) ;

Console.WriteLine(" blob downloaded ");

.NET - Blob metadata
====================================================================

Metadata -> is a key value pair . Example Department IT. 


How to set metadata from .Net program
----------------------------------------


Using Azure.Storage.Blobs;

string connectionString ="constrfromAzureStoreAccount";
string containerName ="DesiredContainerName";
string blobName="script.sql ";
BlobClient bc = new BlobClient(connectionString, ContainerName, blobname); 

 
async Task SetBlobData()
{
BlobClient bc = new BlobClient(connectionString, ContainerName, blobname); 
IDictionary<string,string> metaData = new Dictionary<string,string>();
metaData.Add("Department","IT");
metaData.Add("Department","HR");

await bc.SetMetadataAsync(metaData);


Console.WriteLine("metadata added! ");

}
async Task GetMetaData();
{
BlobProperties blobProperties = await blobClient.GetPropertiesAsync();
foreach(var metaData in blobProperties.Metadata)
{
console.WriteLine("The Key is {0}". medataData.Key);
console.WriteLine("The Value is {0}". medataData.Value);
}


.NET - Blob lease
====================================================================

1. If an update is performed on a blob object by a webapp/ amny program then that application will acquire a lock so that no other application is allowed to change that blob file. 	
2. How to acquire a exclusive lock from an application.


async Task AcquireLease()
{
string blobName ="script.sql";
BlobClient blobClient = new BlobCLient(connectionString, containerName, blobName);
BlobLeaseClient blc = BlobClient.GetBlobLeastClient();
TimeSpan leaseTime = new TimeSpan(0,0,1,00);
Response<BlobLease> response = await blobLeaseClient.AcquireAsync(leaseTime); 
Console.WriteLine("Lease Id is {0}", response.Value.LeaseId);
}


When we run this program and then go to the blob we can see message "This blob has an active lease and can not be deleted or edited". 

AZ-Copy tool 
====================================================================
1. Download az-copy executable from internet and install it 
Note: Authorize AzCopy can be done by Azure AD and SAS. 

 
//To create a container 
azcopy make "https://appstore4040.blob.core.windows.net/tmp?SASKeyofAzureStorageAccount" // This is SAS of our storage account  

copy paste the above lines in az copy. go to path where azcopy executable is resides. then open commande prompt then paste the above commands 
// Upload a blob    format is https://storageaccount/containername/filestoupload/SASaccesskey
azcopy copy "script.sql" "https://appstore4040.blob.core.windows.net/tmp?SASKeyofAzureStorageAccount" // This is SAS of our storage account  


// Download blob    format is https://storageaccount/containername/filestoupload/SASaccesskey "Downloadfilename"
 azcopy copy "https://appstore4040.blob.core.windows.net/tmp?SASKeyofAzureStorageAccount" // This is SAS of our storage account  "script.sql"



 
 Moving a storage from one region to another 
===================================================================

1. To move a storage account, create a copy of your storage account in another region. Then, move your data to that account by using AzCopy, or another tool of your choice.

 

Export a template.
Modify the template by adding the target region and storage account name.
Deploy the template to create the new storage account.
Configure the new storage account.
Move data to the new storage account.
Delete the resources in the source region.
Prerequisites

1. Export template can be found in Storage account -> Automation -> Export template 

In the downloaded template we can change the location of the file and execute that in template deployment 



Azure Blob Change feed
=================================================================
1. purpose - It provides an ordered, guaranteen, durable, immutable read-only log of changes. 
2. Operation - Audit log of events to Blob data - Create, UPdate, Delete
3. The Change feed data is stored ina container name $blobchangefeed (under the same storage account) .
4. Record format - The records are stored in Apache Avro format 

How to enable this? 
-----------------------------------------------------------------
1. Storage Account -> Data protection -> Tracking -> Enable blob change feed -> (Keep track of create, modification and delete changes to blobs in your account.

	* Keep all logs
	* Delete change feed log after (in days)   --  you are now having logs that are going to be stored in the same storage account.

What is Azure Table storage 
=======================================================================
1. This is a service that is used to store non-reational structured data
2. Based on structured NoSQL data
3. You follow a key/attribute store with a schemaless design 


Basically, we dont want to keep any relationship between table to store duplicate data and using complex joins to retrieve data and all. We just need to store data and retrieve it in a faster manner. 		 	


* A table is a collection of entities
* The entities dont abide by any schema
* Each entity can have a different set of properties
* An entity is made up of properties
* Each property is name-value pair


Entity  -- ROW
--------------

Partition key - This is a string vlaue, this identiifed the partition that the entity belong to 
Row key - This is a string value. This uniquely identifies each entity within the partition
The partition key along with the row key helps to uniquely identify the entity within the table. 


Lab - Azure Table storage
===================================================================
1. Storage account -> Tables -> Create table -> Orders
2. Storage browser -> Tables -> Orders -> Add Entity  -> We need to enter Partition key and row key. O1 (Rowkey), MObiles(partitionKey), Quantity. These are three property 
3. As this is schemaless, next entity may have additional property also, example, customerid is added additionally alone with row, partition key, quantity. 


.Net  - Azure Table storage - Add Entity. 
==================================================================
1. Install Azure.Data.Tables from nuget. 
string constr = "";
string tableName ="Orders";

AddEntity("01","Mobiles",100);
AddEntity("02","Laptop", 200);
AddEntity("03","Mobiles",300);
AddEntity("04","Laptop",300);


void AddEntity(string orderId, string category, int quantity)
{
TableClient tc = new TableClient(constr,tableName)
TableEntity te = new TableEntity(category,orderId)
{
{"quantity",quantity}
};
tc.AddEntity(tableEntity);
Console.WriteLine("Added Entity with order ID {0}", orderId);
}


void QueryEntity()
{
TableClient tableClient = new TableClient(constr,tableName);
Pageable<TableEntity> results = tableClient.Query<TableEntity>(entity => entity.PartitionKey==category);
foreach(TableEntity tableentity in results)
{
Console.WriteLine("Order Id {0}", tableEntity.RowKey);
Console.WriteLine("Quantity is {0}",tableEntity.GetInt32("quantity"));
}
}


DeleteEntity(string category, string orderId)
{
TableClient tc = new TableClient(constr,tableName);
tc.DeleteEntity(category, orderId);
Console.WriteLine("Entity Deleted");
} 



Section 8
#######################################################################################

What is Azure cosmos DB?
================================================================

1. Azure Cosmos DB
2. Fully managed NoSQL database
3. you get single digin millisecond response times
4. Scales automatically on demand. 

	* SQL API   -  json based data and sql cinnabds
	* MongoDB   - 
	* Gremlin    -  graph based database
	* Cassandra 
	* Table      


1.Create databased account and choose type of api
2.Database
3.Container
4. Items

             Database Term      Container term     Item Term 

SQL API	      Database            Container          Item

MongoDB	      Database            Collection         Document 

Gremlin	      Database            Graph              Node/Edge

Cassandra     Keyspace   	  Table	             Row

Table  	      Database            Table              Item		

  

Partitions
==============================================================

1. Logical partitions - Items in a container are divided into subsets called logical partitions
2. Partition key - The partition for the item is decided by the partition key that is associated with the item in the container
3. Item id - Each Item also has an item id. This helps to uniquely identity an item in the partition. 
4. Identification - The combination of the partition key and the item id helps to uniquely identify the item within the container 
5. Size  - Each logical parition can grow up to 20 GB
6. Limit - There is no limit of number of logical partitions within the container 


Partition Key
----------------------
* Choose a property to be a partition key which value wont change 
* The property should have a wide range of possible values
* Once you decide on the parition key for a container, you CAN'T CHANGE IT


Costing 
==================================================

Request Units
	* The cost of database operation is measured in terms of Request units
	* Request Units is a blended measure of CPU, IOPS and memory 
	* Request units are used no matter which API you are using for Cosmos DB account 
	* The cost of reading a single item (1KB) is 1 request unit
	* Other operations have their own measure of charged request units 
	* For each operation, you can see the amount of request units that were used for that operation 

Provisioned Throughput
----------------------
1. Here you provision the number of request units. You can always increment or decrement the number of request units provisioned. 
2. You are billed on an hourly basis
3. You can provision throughput at the container or database level 

Serverless mode
-----------------------
1. you dont providion any throughput
2. This is managed by Azure cosmos DB	 
3. You will be billed based on the Request Units you consume

Autoscale Mode
-------------------
1. the Request units can automatically scale based on demadn
2. The demand is checked both at the container and database level.
3. Great for mission critical workloads. 	


Creating new Azure Cosmos DB account
====================================================

1. Create cosmos db account then create container
2. Partition key -> /category id (partition key should have  / in the beginning) -> OK  
3. Go to CosmosDB -> Order (table name) -> Items -> New ITem -> { "orderId":"1", "category":"Laptop","quantity":100} -> Upon saving we will notice some new properties will be added 

{
"orderId":"1",
"catgory":"Laptop",
"quantity":100,
"id":"sysgenerated id",
"_rid":"xys",
"_self":"",
"_etag":"",
"_attachments":"attachments/",
"_ts":160102002,
 
}



Partition key should have variety of values, means it should be the criteria column where we can use group by. In our example orderid is not recommended. Because each order id we will be creating a partition. Category is ideal candidate. 

Objects Within objects.

Order will have customer information, in ideal sql server scenario we will have customer table and we will join and fetch. In the Cosmos DB we are going to create an object within object. Like below

{
"OrderId":"1",
"category":"Laptop",
"quantity":100,
"customer":{
"customerId":"c1",
"customerName":"pravin"
}

we can query like below

SELECT o.orderId, o.category,o.quantity, o.customer.customerName form Orders o



.NET - Create Database and container 
==================================================================
1. Create console application and Install Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos package from nuget
2. program.cs
	string cosmosEndpoint="URLFromAzureCOsmosDBAccount"; 
	string cosmosDBKey ="Primary/secondarykeFromAzureCosmosDBAccount";
CreateDatabase("appDB");
CreateContainer("appDB","Orders","/category");

aysnc Task CreateDatabase(string databaseName)
{
CosmosClient cc = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpoint,cosmosDBKey );
await cc.CreateDatabaseAsync(databaseName);
Console.WriteLine("Database Created");
}

async Task CreateContainer(string databaseName, string containerName, string parititonKey);
{
CosmosClient cc = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpoint,cosmosDBKey );
Database db = cc.GetDatabase(databaseName);
await db.CreateContainerAsync(container, parititonKey);
Console.WriteLine("Container created");
}


Adding an Item
=============================================================

string cosmosEndpoint="URLFromAzureCOsmosDBAccount"; 
string cosmosDBKey ="Primary/secondarykeFromAzureCosmosDBAccount";
string databaseName ="appDB";
string containerName="Orders";
 
AddItem("1","Laptop",100);
AddItem("1","Mobiles",20);
AddItem("1","Desktop",20);
AddItem("1","Laptop",25);


async Task AddItem(string orderId, string category, int quanity)
{
CosmosClient cc = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpoint,cosmosDBKey );
Database db = cc.GetDatabase(databaseName);
Container c = db.GetContainer(ContainerName);

Order order = new Order()
{
id=Guid.NewGuid().Tostring(),  
orderId = orderId,
category = category,
quantity = quantity
}
ItemResponse<order> response = await container.CreateItemAsync<Order>(order, new PartitionKey(category));
Console.WriteLine("Added item with Order Id {0}", orderId);
Console.WriteLine("Request Units {0}", response.RequestCharge); 
}


When we execute the above program we will get "id" required property is missing error. When we adding item from Azure automatically Id property is added by Azure. It is not the case with .net program. 


.net - Reading item
======================================================================

async Task ReadItem()
{
CosmosClient cc = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpoint,cosmosDBKey );
Database db = cc.GetDatabase(databaseName);
Container c = db.GetContainer(ContainerName);

string query = "SELECT O.orderId,o.category,o.quantity from orders o"

QueryDefinition qd = new QueryDefintion(query);
FeedIterator<Order> feedIterator = container.GetItemQueryIterator<order>(qd);

while(feedIterator.HasMoreResults)
{
FeedResponse<Order> feedResponse = await feedIterator.ReadNextAsync();
foreach(Order order in feedResponse)
{
Console.WriteLine("Order Id {0}", order.orderId);
Console.WriteLine("Category {0}", order.category); 
Console.WriteLine("quantity {0}", order.quantity); 

}
}
}

Replace Item
=============================================================

async Task ReadItem()
{
CosmosClient cc = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpoint,cosmosDBKey );
Database db = cc.GetDatabase(databaseName);
Container c = db.GetContainer(ContainerName);

string orderId ="01";
string query = "SELECT O.orderId,o.category,o.quantity from orders o where o.orderId='{orderId}'"

string id="";
string category="";

QueryDefinition qd = new QueryDefintion(query);
FeedIterator<Order> feedIterator = container.GetItemQueryIterator<order>(qd);

while(feedIterator.HasMoreResults)
{
FeedResponse<Order> feedResponse = await feedIterator.ReadNextAsync();
foreach(Order order in feedResponse)
{
id=order.id;
category=order.category;
}
}
  ItemResponse<Order> response = await container.ReadItemAsync<Order>(id, new PartitionKey )
var item = response.Resource;
item.quantity = 150;

await container.ReplaceItemAsync<Order>(item, id, new PartitionKey(category));
Console.WriteLine("Item is updated");
}

Delete Item
=======================================================================

async Task DeleteItem()
{
CosmosClient cc = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpoint,cosmosDBKey );
Database db = cc.GetDatabase(databaseName);
Container c = db.GetContainer(ContainerName);

string orderId ="01";
string query = "SELECT O.orderId,o.category,o.quantity from orders o where o.orderId='{orderId}'"

string id="";
string category="";

QueryDefinition qd = new QueryDefintion(query);
FeedIterator<Order> feedIterator = container.GetItemQueryIterator<order>(qd);

while(feedIterator.HasMoreResults)
{
FeedResponse<Order> feedResponse = await feedIterator.ReadNextAsync();
foreach(Order order in feedResponse)
{
id=order.id;
category=order.category;
}
}
  ItemResponse<Order> response = await container.ReadItemAsync<Order>(id, new PartitionKey )
 
await container.DeleteItemAsync<Order>(item, id, new PartitionKey(category));
Console.WriteLine("Item is updated");
}


.Net - Array of objects - Adding item
===============================================================
await AddItem("c1","pravin","New York",
new List<ORder>() {
new Order 
{
orderId="01",
category="Laptop",
quantity=100
}
new Order
{
orderId="03",
category="Mobile",
quantity=200
}
}

async Task AddArrayItem(string customerId, string customerName, string customerCity, List<Order> order)
{
CosmosClient cc = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpoint,cosmosDBKey );
Database db = cc.GetDatabase(databaseName);
Container c = db.GetContainer(ContainerName);

Customer customer = new Customer()
{

customerId = customerId,
customerName = customerName, 
customerCity = customerCity,
orders = orders
};

container.CreateItemAsync<Customer> (customer,  new PartitionKey(customerCity));
 Console.WriteLine("Item is added",customerId );
}



Stored procedures
====================================================================================

In cosmos DB stored procedures are written in javascript. 

Stored procedure id = Display
function()
{
var context = getContext();
var response = context.getResponse(); 

response.SetBody("Welcome to Stored procedure");

}

 string cosmosEndpointUri ="";
 string cosmosDBkey = "";
 string databaseName="appDB";
 string containerName="orders";

await CallStoredProcedure();
{
CosmoClient cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpointUri, cosmosDBKey);
Container container = cosmosCLient.GetContainer(databaseName, containerName);

var result = container.Scripts.ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync<string>("Display", new PartitionKey(""),null )
Console.WriteLine(result); 
}


Stored Procedure - Add an item
===============================================================

funcation createItems(items)
{
var context = getContext();
var response = context.getResponse();

if(!items)
{
response.setBody("Error: items are undefined");
return;
}

var numOfItems = items.length;
checkLength(numOfItems);

for(let i=0;i<numofItems;i++)
{
createItem(item[i]);
}

}

function checkLength(itemLength)
{
if(itemLength==0)
{
response.setBody("Error: items are undefined");
return;
}

function createItem(item)
{
var collection = context.getCollection();
var collectionLink = collection.getSelfLink();

collection.createDocument(collectionLink,item);

}

}


 string cosmosEndpointUri ="";
 string cosmosDBkey = "";
 string databaseName="appDB";
 string containerName="orders";

CosmoClient cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpointUri, cosmosDBKey);
Container container = cosmosCLient.GetContainer(databaseName, containerName);


dynamic[] orderItems = new dynamic[]
{
new 
{
id=Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
orderid="01",
category="Laptop",
quantity=30
},
new 
{
id=Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
orderid="02",
category="Mobile",
quantity=40
}
}
var result = container.Scripts.ExecuteStoredProcedureAsync<string>("Display", new PartitionKey("Laptop"), new[] orderedItem )
Console.WriteLine(result); 



Triggers
================================================================
Triggers we have pre and post triggers. We can do that pre and post triggers in cosmos DB as well, it will be in javascript function. 

Trigger Type -> Pre/Post
Trigger Operation -> Create / Delete/ Replace
Trigger Body -> 

function ValidateItem()
{
var context = getContext();
var request = context.getRequest();
var item = request.getBody();

if(!("quantity" in item) )
{
item["quantity"]=0;
}

request.setBody(item)
}


 string cosmosEndpointUri ="";
 string cosmosDBkey = "";
 string databaseName="appDB";
 string containerName="orders";

CosmoClient cosmosClient = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpointUri, cosmosDBKey);
Container container = cosmosCLient.GetContainer(databaseName, containerName);


dynamic[] orderItems = new dynamic[]
{
new 
{
id=Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
orderid="01",
category="Laptop",
quantity=30
};

container.CreateItemAsync(orderItem, null, new ItemRequestOptions { PreTriggers = new List<string> {"validateItem"}})

// we can call multiple triggers, in the above example just calling one trigger. 


Change feed
==============================================================

Record Changes -> Here changes to the container are recorded in the order that they occur. 

Feed - The feed consists of inserts and updates. Deletes are not recorded. 

Process change feed - you can process the change feed with the use of Azure Functions or change feed processor. 

Records - The records for the change feed are written to another container

Sorting - The change feed is sorted in the order of modification within each logical partition key values. 

Throughtput 0 the same provisioned throughput can be used to read from the container containing the changes. 


Lab Change feed - Azure functions
================================================================

Create new Azure function -> Cosmos DB account connection (select Cosmos DB connection name)
Database name -> appDB
Collection -> orders
Collection name for leases -> leases

Create lease cllection if it does not exist 

// Azure function code. 
using System;
using System.Collection.Generic;
using Microsoft.Azure.Documents;  

public static void Run(IReadOnlyList<Document> input, Ilogger log)
{
if(input !=null && input.Count > 0)
{
log.LogInformation("Documents modified " + input.Count);
log.LogInformation("First document id " + input[0].Id);
}
}


Change Feed Processor
================================================================================

1. Monitored Container - This has the data from which the change feed is generated. 
2. Lease container  - This stores the state and coordinates the processing of change feed across multiple workers. 
3. Computer Instances - This hosts the change feed processor that is used to listen for changes. 
4. Delegate - This is the code that is used to process the batch of changes. 	


Change Feed Processor 

	* The change feed processor library automatically check for change 	
	* If the changes are foud they pushed to the client 
	* If you have enough throughput and lot of changes that need to be read, you can have multiple clients to read the change feed. 


.net program.cs
----------------------------

using CosmosDB;
using Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos;

string cosmosEndpointUri = "";
string cosmosDBKey ="";
string databasename= "appDB";
string monitoredContainerName ="Orders";
string leaseCOntainerName ="leases";

await StartChangeProcessor();

async Task StartChangePRocessor()
{
CosmosClient cc = new CosmosClient(cosmosEndpointUri,cosmosDBKey );
Container container = cc.GetContainer(databasenmae, leasecontainerName);
ChangeFeedProcessor cfp = cosmosCLient.GetContainer(databaseName, monitoredContainerName )
	.GetChangeFeedProcessorBuilder<Order>(processorName: "ManageChanges", onChangesDelegate , onChangesDelegate: ManageChanges )
	.WithInstance("appHost")
	.WithLeaseContainer(leasecontainer)
	.Build()

Console.WriteLine("Starting the change feed processor");
await changeFeedProcessor.StartAsync();
Console.Read();
await changeFeedProcessor.StopAsync()
}

static async Task ManageChanges(
ChangeFeedProcessContext context, IReadOnlyCollection<Order> itemCollection, 
CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
foreach(Order item in itemCollection)
{
Console.WriteLine("Id {0}", item.id);
Console.WriteLine("Order Id {0}", item.orderId);
Console.WriteLine("Creation time {0}", item.creationTime);
}
}


Composite Indexes
============================================================

1. SELECT * FROM C ORDER BY C.category; this will run. If we order by both category and quantity then we will get the below error. "The order by query does not have a corresponding composite index that it can be served from."
2. Order container -> Settings -> Indexing policy - > add the below property

"compositeIndexes" :[
[
{
"path": "/category",
"order":"ascending"
},
{
"path": "/quantity",
"order":"ascending"
}
]
]

now the query with both category and quantity oreder by will work. 


Time To live
===================================================================

Delete Items - Here items from the container can be deleted automatically after certain period of time. 
Level - This can be set at the item level or container level. 
Deletion process - Item will be deleted based on the Time to live that is set in seconds. 
Background task -  The deletion process is done as a background task that uses the left-over Request Units. 
For the item - For the TTL to work at the item level, the setting should also be defined at the container level
Benefit - Here the process of deletion is managed by Azure Cosmos DB.


Orders -> Settings -> Time to live - 10 seconds

Consistency 
================================================================
1. Azure Cosmos DB account -> Settings -> Default Consistency
	1. Strong
	2. Bound Staleness
	3. Session
	4. Consistent prefix
	5. Eventual

Replicate Data globally -> Write Region West US. But if our customers more mostly reside in Centra US then we can replicate the data to Central US so that the latency will be less. 

But it will cost us for additional RU/s and storage cost. Remember write will be happening only from West US, Central US is our read regions. 


If user writes data from one region then the data should be replicated, before that if some user reads the data then it will not be latest. We have different consistency levels. 

Strong - The reads are guananteed to return the most recent committed version. This consistency will give more latency and less throughput. Because till the data is replicated application is not allowed to read data from it. 

Bounded staleness - Here the reads might lag behind writes by at most K versions of an item or T time interval. 

Maxmimum Lag(time) Days/Hours/Minutes/Seconds or Maximum Lag (Operations) 

Session - Here within a single client session, the reads are guaranteed to honor the consistent prefix, monotonic reads and writes, read-your-writes and write-follows-read guarantees. 
Consisten prefix - Here client will not see out of order writes. 
Eventual - Eventually the data will be consistent. But there is no order gurantee for the reads. 



Section 12
################################################################################3

1. Consider a scenario we have an application to upload videos, once the upload is over another application need to process it. 
Consider we have many instances to process the video, then we should ensure each application should take unique  video should not take same video by multiple applicaiton. Also If suppose application took one video to process then failed in between then there should be a way to convey other / same instances to take that video and reprocess it. 

To achieve these kinds of operation requires the messaging services. Where we are decoupling the application which process the application and list of videos to be processed in a seperate services. This is where queue storage comes into picture. We can handle retry on failure and many more advanced feature available on messaging services like service bus. 

Azure Storage Queue
================================================================

1. Need a general purpose V2 account. -> Add Queue -> Add messages ->  Message Text, Expires in 7 days by default -> 
Click on the messages we can see the below properties. Id, Message body, Insertion time, Expiration time, Dequeue count 
2. Dequeue message -> will remove FIFO order. Clear queue will remove all messages. 


.Net Sending messages
===============================================================
Program.cs 

using.Azure.Storage.Queues;

string connectionString="Constr from Queue -> accesskey";
string queueName="appqueue";


SendMessage("Test Message 1");
SendMessage("Test Message 2");

void SendMessage(string message)
{
QueueClient qc = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName);

if(qc.Exists())
{
qc.SendMessage(message);
Console.WriteLine("The message has been sent");
}
}


// Peek message will not remove message from queue, but we will be able to read messages
void PeekMessage()
{
QueueClient qc = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName);

int maxMessages = 10;

PeekedMessage[] peekMessages = qc.PeekMessages(maxMessages);

foreach(var peekMessage in peekMessages)
{
console.WriteLine(peekMessage.Body);
}

}


Receive Message
=========================================================================
void ReceiveMessage()
{
QueueClient qc = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName);

int maxMessages = 10;

QueueMessage[] queueMessages = qc.ReceiveMessages(maxMessages);

foreach(var message in peekMessages)
{
console.WriteLine(message.Body);
qc.DeleteMessage(message.MessageId, message.PopReceipt)
}

}

Please note ReceiveMessage is two step process, it will read and remove the messages from queue and if the message is not successfully processed then it should delete the message or else the message will be placed back to queue. If you see the dequeue count is 1 now. So lets add delete message in our program 


Get QueueLength 
================================================================

int GetQueueLength()
{
QueueClient qc = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName) 
if(queueClient.Exists())
{
QueueProperties prop = qc.GetProperties();
return properties.ApproximateMessageCount;
}
return 0;

}

Sending and Receiving objects
=====================================================================

void SendMessage(string orderid, int quantity)
{
QueueClient qc = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName) 
if(qc.Exists())
{
 Order order = new Order {OrderId = orderid, Quantity=quantity};
qc.SendMessage(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(order));
Console.WriteLine("The Order information has been sent");
}
} 


Azure storage Queue - Azure functions
===================================================================

1. Create new Azure Function -> Queue trigger -> Storage emulator ( Connection string setting name => connectionString, Queue Name => appqueue


public class Queue
{
[FunctionName("GetMessages")]
public void Run([QueueTrigger("appqueue",Connection="connectionString")]string myQueueItem, Ilogger log )
{

log.LogInformation($"C# Queue trigger function processed:{myQueueItem}");
}
}


At this point of time, we would receive message "The input is not a valid Base-64 string as it contains a non-base 64 character, more than two padding characters "


If the message is not delivered after defined max recount then it will be moved to  originalqueueName-poison  


void SendMessage(string orderid, int quantity)
{
QueueClient qc = new QueueClient(connectionString, queueName) 
if(qc.Exists())
{
 Order order = new Order {OrderId = orderid, Quantity=quantity};
 var jsonObject = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(order);
var bytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(jsonObject);
var message = System.Convert.ToBase64String(bytes);

qc.SendMessage(message);
Console.WriteLine("The Order information has been sent");
}
} 


Output to Table Storage 
====================================================================

1. Create a table called Orders
2. Create a class to represent table Order 

public class TableOrder
{
public string PartitionKey {get;set;}
public string RowKey {get; set;}


}


public class Queue
{
[FunctionName("GetMessages")]
[return: Table("Orders", Connection="connectionString")]
public TableOrder Run([QueueTrigger("appqueue",Connection="connectionString")]string myQueueItem, Ilogger log )
{

TableOrder to = new TableOrder()
{
PartitionKey = order.OrderId
RowKey = order.Quantity.ToString() 
}
log.LogInformation("Order Information has been written to the table"); 
return tableOrder;
}
}



Another way of writing the code to output to table storage
You can actually also write the below code to write to Azure Table storage

Here in the definition of the Run method, you can add a reference to the table. And then also add the output type as ICollector. Then add the table objects to the ICollector Interface reference.



using System;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs;
using Microsoft.Azure.WebJobs.Host;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
 
namespace QueueFunction
{
    public class Queues
    {
        [FunctionName("GetMessages")]
        
        public void Run([QueueTrigger("appqueue", Connection = "connectionString")]Order order, ILogger log, [Table("Orders", Connection = "connectionString")]ICollector<TableOrder> tableorder)
        {
            TableOrder tableOrder = new TableOrder()
            {
                PartitionKey = order.OrderID,
                RowKey = order.Quantity.ToString()
            };
            tableorder.Add(tableOrder); 
            log.LogInformation("Order written to table");
            
        }
    }
}


Azure Queue Message Trigger  - Important Note
================================================================

Concurrecy 

Concurrency
When there are multiple queue messages waiting, the queue trigger retrieves a batch of messages and invokes function instances concurrently to process them. By default, the batch size is 16. When the number being processed gets down to 8, the runtime gets another batch and starts processing those messages. So the maximum number of concurrent messages being processed per function on one virtual machine (VM) is 24. This limit applies separately to each queue-triggered function on each VM. If your function app scales out to multiple VMs, each VM will wait for triggers and attempt to run functions. For example, if a function app scales out to 3 VMs, the default maximum number of concurrent instances of one queue-triggered function is 72.

The batch size and the threshold for getting a new batch are configurable in the host.json file. If you want to minimize parallel execution for queue-triggered functions in a function app, you can set the batch size to 1. This setting eliminates concurrency only so long as your function app runs on a single virtual machine (VM).

The queue trigger automatically prevents a function from processing a queue message multiple times simultaneously.


Azure Service Bus
====================================================================================================

Azure Service Bus is fully managed Enterprise message broker.

Data can include structured encoded data with formats. JSON , XML, Apache avro

* The messages in the queue are ordered 
* The messages are held in triple-redundant storage (means we wont lose our messages even in failure. redundate 3 times for backup)
* The data is available across availablility zones if enabled
* The messages can then be retrieved via the pull mode. 


Topics 
-------------------

The subscriber to the topic will receive a copy of the message sent to the topic

You can define rules which contain filters on each subscription. The filter will decide which mesages are received by the subscription. 


Creating an Azure Service bus Queue
============================================================
1. Create Service Bus -> Namespace name -> 	Pricing Tier (Basic -only supports Queue, Standard - supports queue and Topics) 
2. Queue ->  
	* Max queue size -  
	* Max delivery count  
	* Message time to Live
	* Lock Duration 
	* Enable auto-delete on idle
	* Enable duplicate detection 
	* Enable dead lettering on message expiration 
	* Enable partitioning 
	* Enable sessions
 	* Forward messages to queue/topic
 
In  Service Bus namespace -> Service bus Explorer -> We can send / Receive / Peek on the azure portal 


Azure Service Bus queues - .Net sending messages
===========================================================================
1. Create .net project and install Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus ->   
2. Azure Service Bus queue -> Shared access policies -> Add ->  Manage / Send /Listen -> Save -> now we will get primary and secondary key. 
3. Program.cs  -> 

using Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus;
using ServiceBusQueue;

List<Order> orders = new List<Order)()
{
new Order() {orderId="1",Quantity=100,unitPrice=9.9f},
new Order() {orderId="2",Quantity=200,unitPrice=9.9f},
new Order() {orderId="3",Quantity=300,unitPrice=9.9f}
}	

async Task SendMessage(List<Order> orders)
{

ServiceBusClient sbc = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString);
ServiceBusSender sbs = serviceBusClient.CreateSender(queueName);

ServiceBusMessageBatch sbmb = await serviceBusSender.CreateMessageBatchAsync()

foreach(Order order in orders)
{
if(!sbmb.TryAddMssage(
	new ServiceBusMessage(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(order))))
{
throw new Exception("Error occured");
}

}
Console.WriteLine("Sending messages");
await sbs.SendMessagesAsync(sbmb);
}


Peek Message
=================================================================

async Task PeekMessages()
{

ServiceBusClient serviceBusClient = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString);
ServiceBusReceiver serviceBusReceiver = serviceBusClient.CreateReceiver(queueName, 
	new ServiceBusReceiverOptions() { ReceiveMode = ServiceBusReceiveMode.PeekLock });

IAsyncEnumerable<ServiceBusReceivedMessage> messages = serviceBusReceiver.ReceiveMessagesAsync();

await foreach(ServiceBusReceivedMessage message in messages)
{
Order order = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Order>(message.Body.ToString());
Console.WriteLine("Order Id {0}",order.OrderId);
Console.WriteLine("Quantity {0}",order.Quantity);
Console.WriteLine("Unit price {0}",order.UnitPrice);
})
}




==============================================================================


async Task SendMessage(List<Order> orders)
{

ServiceBusClient sbc = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString);
ServiceBusSender sbs = serviceBusClient.CreateSender(queueName);

ServiceBusMessageBatch sbmb = await serviceBusSender.CreateMessageBatchAsync()

foreach(Order order in orders)
{

ServiceBusMessage serviceBusMessage = new ServiceBusMessage(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(order));
serviceBusMessage.ContentType = "application/json";
serviceBusMessage.ApplicationProperties.Add("Importance","High")

if(!sbmb.TryAddMssage(
	serviceBusMessage))
{
throw new Exception("Error occured");
}

}
Console.WriteLine("Sending messages");
await sbs.SendMessagesAsync(sbmb);
}



application level properties can be read by ApplicationProperties["PropertyName"] ;



Message Processor 
=====================================================================
1. Create message processor method
ServiceBusClient sbc = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString);
ServiceBusProcessor serviceBusProcessor = serviceBusClient.CreateProcessor(queueName, new ServiceBusProcessorOptions());

serviceBusProcessor.ProcessMessageAsync += ProcessMessage;
serviceBusProcessor.ProcessErrorAsync   += ErrorHandler;

await serviceBusProcessor.StartProcessingAsync();
Console.WriteLine("Waitint for messages");
Console.ReadKey();

await serviceBusProcessor.StopProcessingAsync();
await serviceBusProcessor.DisposeAsync();
await serviceBusClient.DisposeAsync();

static async Task ProcessMessage(ProcessMessageEventArgs message)
{
Order order = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Order>(messageEvent.Message.Body.ToString());
Console.WriteLine("Order Id {0}",order.orderId);
Console.WriteLine("Quantity {0}",order.Quantity);
Console.WriteLine("UnitPrice {0}",order.UnitPrice);

}

static Task ErrorHandler(ProcessErrorEventArgs args)
{
Console.WriteLine(args.Exception.ToString());
return Task.CompletedTask;
}


Message Lock Duration 
=================================================================


async Task PeekMessages()
{
//Peeklock will pick the message from the queue and lock it for the lock duration mentioned in the azure portal, after that lock duration another application can access that message. If that message is not processed by previous pick. 
ServiceBusClient serviceBusClient = new ServiceBusClient(connectionString);
ServiceBusReceiver serviceBusReceiver = serviceBusClient.CreateReceiver(queueName, 
	new ServiceBusReceiverOptions() { ReceiveMode = ServiceBusReceiveMode.PeekLock });

ServiceBusReceivedMessage  messages =await serviceBusReceiver.ReceiveMessageAsync();

 
Order order = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<Order>(message.Body.ToString());
Console.WriteLine("Order Id {0}",order.OrderId);
Console.WriteLine("Quantity {0}",order.Quantity);
Console.WriteLine("Unit price {0}",order.UnitPrice);
 
await serviceBusReceiver.CompleteMessageAsync(message); // this will mark our message operation as complete and dlete the message from the queue. 
}



Time To Live
=======================================================================

How long our messages should be active. After this Time to Live period messages should be saved permemnantly to dead letter queue. Provided dead letter queue is enabled and its not manually deleted. 

We can do peek-lock delivery. 

We can read this messages from dead letter queue as well. for that below is the setting

string queueName="appqueue/$DeadLetterQueue"
on connection string in the end  - Entitypath=appqueue/$DeadLetterQueue\


Duplicate Message Detection
=======================================================================
You can't enable or disable duplicate detection after the queue or topic is created.

1. Enable duplicate detection during queue creation -> enable time duration -> We need to keep some unique id, with the same id, it wont allow messages for 10 (whatever time duration we have mentioned ) mins duration time.

2. Create new SAS and update in .net program and update the new queue name. (Please note we have RootManageSharedAccessKey where we can access all the queue )


Azure Service Bus - Topics
=================================================================

1. Its a publisher subcriber model, if application subscribe to a topic then it will receive message when a message is published in that topic. 
2. Create a topic then under topic -> create 2 subscriptions - > 
3. Go to service bus explorer -> send message -> now both subscripers will get this message. 
4. When peek or receive, we need to tell on behalf of which subscription we are doing that. 


Sending Messages from .Net 
=======================================================================
There is no changes in sending messages same as storage queue. 
1. Create .net project and install Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus
2. Create Shared access key for send -> and upadte this key in connection string. 
3. Define topicName 



Sending Messages from .Net 
=======================================================================
There is no changes in sending messages same as storage queue.  
1. Create .net project and install Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus
2. Create .net project and install Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus
2. Create Shared access key for send -> and upadte this key in connection string. 


Sending Messages from .Net 
=======================================================================

1.Create .net project and install Azure.Messaging.ServiceBus
2. Install ServiceBusTopicReceiver from nuget. 
3. Create access policy to listen to messages and copy access key to this program connection string, topic name and subscriptionName in the ServiceBusReceiver code

Topic Filters
=======================================================================
1. Subscripers can decide which messages they want to receive, with the help of fileters.
2. This can be defined with the use of rules
3. Each rule has a filter condition.
4. The message will contain a property called RuleName that shows the matching rule. 

Types of files
* Boolean filters - this is either the TrueFilter or FalseFilter. This can cause all the messages to be send to the subscription or for the subscription to receive no messages.
* SQL filters  - Here SQL like language can be used to evaluate the messages user-defined or system properties
* Correlation filters - Here also conditions can be matched against the messages user or system defined properties. 
* Correlation filters are more efficient than SQL filters. 


Boolean Filters
=================================
1. Go to subscription -> Overview -> Filters -> Add filter -> put condition like 1=0 -> This is always false and no messages will be recieved to the subscription under that particular topic. 

SQL Filters 
==========================================================

There are two types of properties. 
	1. User defined properties, this will go like user.Importance="High", so this topic will pick message only if the user defined Importance property is equal to High
	2. System properties, this will work like sys.MessageId='1' only then pick that message. 
	3. We can use like opertion etc in sql filter. 

Correlation filters
==============================================================

Correlation filters are same as sql filter, but we will have list of properties on a dropdown we can choose system and Custom properties and give values for our condition. It is efficient than sql filter.
